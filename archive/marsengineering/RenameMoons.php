<h1>The Renaming of Mars' Moons</h1>

<p>The idea of renaming Mars' moons arose whilst I was thinking of names for sols of the week for
  an early version of the <a href='http://www.marscalendar.com/'>Kepler Calendar</a>, then known
  as the Areosynchronous Calendar. I wanted to allocate one sol per week to each of Mars' moons -
  just as on Earth we have one day per week named for the Moon ('Monday' in English), I initially
  named two sols, 'Phobosol' and 'Deimosol', for the moons of Mars.</p>

<p>I realized, however, that these translated to 'Fear Day' and 'Terror Day'. [Note that the words
  'Phobos' and 'Deimos' have very similar meanings. Phobos is most frequently interpreted as
  'fear', but also 'fright', or 'terror'. Deimos is most frequently interpreted as 'flight' or
  'terror', but also 'panic', 'dread', or 'fear'.] I thought more about this and wondered whether
  I would want to live on a planet with Fear and Terror circling overhead.</p>

<p>Of course, we will be scientists and engineers, and not swayed by such primitive superstitions
  - they're just lumps of rock, right? Your subconscious might disagree. In any case, while
  scientists may think "what's in a name? A lump of carbonaceous rock by any other name is still a
  lump of carbonaceous rock", it is well-known that <i>human beings are naturally
    superstitious</i>. We are not building a Mars for scientists, we are building it for <i>everyone</i>.
  I suspect that I'm not the only one who would prefer different names for the Martian moons, and,
  although it may not be an easy thing to change, I was inspired to research the topic further and
  propose some ideas.</p>

<h3>Mars and Ares</h3>

<p>When Asaph Hall discovered the moons of Mars in August of 1877, he took the advice of Henry
  Madan of England, and named the satellites 'Phobos' and 'Deimos', after the attendants of Ares
  mentioned in the fifteenth book of <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~joelja/iliad.html"
    target=_new>Homer's Iliad</a>. Note that in Samuel Butler's and other translations of the
  Iliad, 'Mars' is written instead of 'Ares'. This is because many scholars view these two as
  equivalent. Ares was a Greek god, whereas Mars was Roman.</p>

<p>Although Mars is commonly equated with Ares, the two are actually different. Ares was only
  concerned with war - as Zeus says to Ares in Book 5 of the Iliad: "Most hateful to me are you of
  all gods on Olympus, for ever is strife dear to you and wars and fightings." Mars, however, was
  originally an agricultural god, responsible for springtime, growth in nature, fertility, and
  cattle.</p>

<p>How, then, did Mars become equated with Ares? The reason for this is not well known, but
  perhaps it is because the history of the Roman Empire was full of war, and although the Roman
  people were originally pastoral, they became very warlike in nature. The Roman army gathered in
  Mars' temple before battle, and this is probably how Mars became strongly associated with war.
  Another possible reason is that wars were often begun or renewed in March, the month named for
  Mars because it was the beginning of Spring.</p>

<p>Mars had a much better reputation than Ares - Mars was seen as noble and honorable, whereas
  Ares was considered savage and brutal. Ares was not a popular Greek god, whereas Mars was one of
  the most popular and worshipped Roman gods (second only to Jupiter) and had several festivals in
  his honour.</p>

<h3>Mars, the god of agriculture, growth, and fertility</h3>

<p>It is my dream to one day emigrate to Mars. In fact, I would like to be one of the first
  settlers - sometime in the 2030's (when I'm in my 60's), maybe I can hop a flight to the new
  world and stake my claim.</p>

<p>If Mars is to be my future home, I much prefer the image of Mars as the god of agriculture,
  growth, and fertility. This image of Mars inspires belief in the success of terraforming, the
  abundance of food and good health, and the proliferation of life on Mars. It is, however,
  difficult to escape the image of Mars as a war god with Fear and Terror circling overhead. This
  is why I think it's essential that the Martian moons be renamed - whether to remind us that Mars
  was a god of agriculture and fertility, or at least just to be more positive and encouraging
  concepts than Fear and Terror!</p>

<h3>Alternative names for the Martian satellites</h3>

<p>Other names have been proposed for the Martian moons before. Brian Aldiss and Roger Penrose in
  "White Mars" rename Phobos as 'Swift' and Deimos as 'Laputa'. Edgar Rice Burroughs named the
  larger Barsoomian moon 'Thuria' and the smaller, more distant, was 'Cluros'.</p>

<p>At first I considered renaming the moons after Mars' twin sons and founders of Rome,
  <b>Romulus</b> and <b>Remus</b> (Phobos and Deimos were actually the sons of Ares), however
  after investigating the mythology around these two characters, I decided that they were not the
  best choice. In Roman mythology, the twins quarrelled when dividing up rulership of Rome, and
  Romulus killed Remus. This story would not carry positive overtones for the future of Mars!</p>

<p>I decided that, as Mars was a Roman god, the best place to search for new names would be in the
  area of Roman mythology. Many names that may have been suitable have already been assigned to
  minor planets, for example: Bellona (goddess of war, Mars' sister or daughter); Minerva (goddess
  of science, trade, and war); Victoria (goddess of victory); Felicitas (goddess of success);
  Virtus (god of courage and virtue); and Fortuna (goddess of good luck).</p>

<p>Fortunately there are so many Roman gods and goddesses that there remain several whose names
  have not been used for minor planets yet might be useful for Mars' moons. After considering
  Libertas (goddess of freedom), Voluptas (goddess of satisfaction and pleasure), Fecunditas
  (goddess of growth and fertility), Lactanus (god of vitality and growth), Robigus (god of
  grain), Ubertas (god of wealth and plenty), and Vertumnus (god of seasons), I finally settled on
  <b>Nerio</b> and <b>Liber</b>.

<p><b>Nerio</b> - 'the strong one' - originally a Sabine fertility goddess, she was the wife of
  Mars. Her name means 'strength', 'courage', and 'valour'. I expect Mars would like to have his
  wife around, and the attributes expressed are very positive and encouraging.</p>

<p><b>Liber</b> - 'the free one' - god of vegetation, husbandry, fertility, growth in nature,
  countryside, and also associated with wild personalities, passionate lovemaking,
  <!-- sexual liberty, --> grapevines and wine. Liber, along with Ceres, has a strong link with
  Mars - they were the gods to whom Mars' agricultural responsibilities passed when he became the
  god of war. ['Ceres' was the name given to the largest, first-discovered asteroid. She orbits in
  the main belt between Mars and Jupiter and can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, from both
  Mars and Earth.]</p>

<p>If you want to search for some names, check out some of the Roman mythology references at the
  bottom of the page. Don't forget to check the <a
    href="http://www.ipa.nw.ru/PAGE/DEPFUND/LEMP/ENG/englenam.htm" target=_new>list of minor
    planet names</a> to make sure they haven't already been used.</p>

<p>I was tempted to suggest the name <b>Abeona</b>, the Roman goddess who protects children when
  they leave the house for the first time, however I decided that this name would probably lose
  significance as Mars became more independent. I think it's a good name for an early Mars
  mission.</p>

<h3>Nerio and Liber</h3>

<p>My feeling is that these are the two perfect names for the Martian moons. Both of these
  characters have strong links with Mars and both express positive attributes, Nerio being 'the
  strong one' and Liber being 'the free one'. Both are also associated with fertility, although
  Liber much more so, being a fairly important agricultural god. Liber was also in charge of
  grapevines, so presumably Martian wine will benefit from his influence! Liber, as a Martian moon
  and eventually a space station, could become our Martian 'Statue of Liberty'.</p>

<p>Which name to which moon? My suggestion is that Phobos (the closer, larger moon) be renamed
  'Nerio' and Deimos (the further, smaller moon) be renamed 'Liber'. We would then see Nerio twice
  a day, reminding us to be courageous and strong, and Mars would have his wife close by. Distant
  Liber we would only see occasionally, as he moves slowly over the surface of the planet,
  steadily shining fertility and growth on each part of the land, and reminding us that we are
  free.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>What do you think? Is it a good idea to rename Mars' moons? Do you think the names 'Nerio' and
  'Liber' are the right ones? Please feel welcome to <a
