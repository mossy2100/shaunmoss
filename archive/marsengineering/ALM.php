<h1>The ALM (Antarctica-Luna-Mars) Strategy for Space Colonization</h1>

<p>As the enormously successful Apollo program taught us, success is achieved 
  by careful preparation - a grand challenge must be approached one cautious step 
  at a time, to ensure confidence in the technology and to develop skills and 
  experience in the engineers. It is wise to adopt the same philosophy with respect 
  to the colonization of Mars. A careful, well-planned strategy for reaching the 
  the new world is necessary, to minimize danger, and maximize both financial 
  and scientific profitability.</p>
<p>Antarctica provides us with a unique opportunity to develop colonization technologies. 
  The most apparent of these is that Antarctica is the coldest and dryest place 
  on the Earth - it is an environment totally unsuited to humans. If we are able 
  to demonstrate life-support strategies and technologies in Antarctica, we will 
  be well prepared for developing those technologies required for survival on 
  Luna and Mars.</p>
<p>Within the Mars community it is sometimes said: 'if you want to go to Mars, go to Mars', and that all this mucking about with Antarctica and the Moon should be avoided, but I think this is a dangerous philosophy. I understand that many people would like to see the fruits of their labour during their lifetime, in the form of humans 
  on Mars, however this impatience is not really in the best interests of the 
  astronauts whose lives are at risk. I agree that Mars is our destination, however 
  Antartica and Luna provide us with golden opportunities to practice and 
  develop our colonization technologies. An intelligent species would take advantage 
  of these opportunities.</p>
<h3>Why Mars is our destination</h3>
<p>I expect that Luna will probably develop in a similar way to that of Antarctica 
  since its discovery. There are several attributes of Luna that make it difficult 
  to colonize - it has practically no atmosphere; high levels of radiation; a 
  month-long day; enormous extremes of temperature; and only tiny deposits of 
  water. It will be hard to live on the Moon - its inhabitants may have to spend 
  most of their time underground to provide shielding from solar radiation; during 
  the 2-week lunar night, they will live in artificial light; and food will have 
  to be imported from Earth (maybe not always, but at least initially). Similar 
  to Antarctica, Luna will probably be inhabited by a relatively small population, 
  primarily used for scientific purposes (and possibly mining), and frequented by tourists.</p>
<p>Of course, Mars is also difficult to colonize, however, it has much greater potential. 
  Mars has a tangible atmosphere, significant amounts of water, seasons, weather, 
  and a day-night cycle very similar to Earth's. It is cold (average -60&deg;C), 
  and the atmosphere is very thin and largely composed of carbon dioxide, however, 
  Mars can be terraformed (manipulated to be more like Earth), until eventually 
  humans and other Earthly life forms can thrive out in the open on the Martian 
  surface. Even if it proves extremely difficult to adapt Earthly life forms to 
  the Martian climate, advances in genetic engineering will enable the creation 
  of new organisms especially suited to Mars. Mars will one day teem with life 
  - it is the new world.</p>
<p>Mars will develop in two distinct stages. The first stage will be adaptation 
  - humans and Mars learning to live together in symbiosis. During this stage 
  we'll develop our survival skills and technologies, effective terraforming processes, 
  communications and transport infrastructures, societal systems, agriculture, 
  materials science, and so on. Most of Mars' inhabitants during this time will 
  probably be astronauts, scientists, engineers, and communicators, and they will 
  live in enclosed, controlled environments with Earth-like air and temperature.</p>
<p>Mars is attractive and many people will still want to travel to Mars, even 
  to live in enclosed environments, so there will probably be a steady stream of 
  curious and adventurous souls from Earth during this period. The sol (Martian day) will eventually 
  come, however, when the terraforming process has reached a critical point and 
  a human can walk on the surface of Mars without the aid of technology. That sol will mark 
  the beginning of a flood of humanity towards Mars, and thus also the beginning 
  of large-scale interplanetary commerce and travel. It will be a new era for 
  both Earth and Mars.</p>
<p>When this sol will be is a guess - it may take anywhere between 100 and 
  1000 years before a human can walk on the Martian surface unaided by technology 
  - however, our current knowledge suggests that <i>it is possible</i>, and our 
  imagination affirms that it is also worthwhile, regardless of how long it takes. 
  The ALM strategy is aimed at this precise target.</p>
<h3>Antarctica and Luna as stepping-stones to Mars</h3>
<p>The primary technology required for Mars habitation is <b>environment control</b>. 
  On a planet whose temperature range is between -140&deg;C and 20&deg;C, and 
  whose atmosphere is thin and comprised mainly of carbon dioxide, we must create 
  little bubbles of Earth - enclosed self-contained environments with a comfortable 
  15-20&deg;C and breathable air.</p>
