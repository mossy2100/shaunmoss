<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>Silvergreen is designed according to a certain philosophy,
	and it is expected that the people who choose to
	live in this remarkable community will probably
subscribe, at least to some degree, to this philosophy.</p>
<p>This philosophy is one for the planet, not just
	for our small ecovillage.&nbsp; We are building this
	ecovillage with a certain design pattern that we
	hope will be replicated at larger scales
	of development. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1.&nbsp; Land care and conservation </h2>
<p>Most important is the way we use the land.&nbsp; By
	allocating at least half the land for natural wildlife
	and vegetation, we preserve the ecosystem that
	is necessary for the overall health of the planet.&nbsp; Having
	a high tree population ensures our oxygen supply
	and acts as a carbon sink.&nbsp; Furthermore, native
	vegetation also provides food and shelter to wildlife,
	which is both enjoyable and serves to further expand
	the biosphere.</p>
<p>At this time, it is not enough to simply use the
	land in a &quot;neutral&quot; way.&nbsp; We have taken
	so much from Earth that for at least the next
	100 years we must strive to put something back
	at every opportunity.&nbsp; Hence
	we will actively rehabilitate previously cleared
	sections of land by  planting thousands of native
	trees, and nurture the ecosystem until
	it becomes vibrant, full of life, self-sustaining
	and healthy.</p>
<p>Unlike most housing developments where the developers
	slice a piece of land up into blocks, Silvergreen
	will be owned by the whole community.&nbsp; It will
	not be accurate to say &quot;this bit is mine and that
	bit is yours&quot;.&nbsp; Rather, any resident will
	be able to stand on any part of the site and say,
	&quot;I'm a part owner of this&quot;.&nbsp; This will
	change the way people think about the land, and
	hopefully everyone will take responsibility for
	all of it instead of just &quot;their bit&quot;.&nbsp; This
	is one of the most important ideas that we
	hope will spread across the whole planet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2.&nbsp; Independence</h2>
<p>In these historical times, literally anything can
	happen.&nbsp; Most
	human communities, at least in Australia and other
	industrialised nations, rely on centralised
	statewide or national &quot;grids&quot; for water and energy
	supplies.&nbsp; Similarly, we rely on farms in rural
	areas to provide food for the large population
	centres.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this setup, some
	of which are becoming very apparent.</p>
<p>With regard to water, low rainfall means that our
	dams do not hold an abundant supply for the population,
	hence water restrictions.&nbsp; By producing our own
	water on-site through a combination of rainwater
	harvesting, purification and recycling, we become
	free of that constraint.&nbsp; Our water will also
	cost considerably less because we will not have
	to pay for the energy and infrastructure embodied
	in town water.&nbsp; Most
	importantly, if the state water supply fails for
	any reason, we will still have plenty of high quality
	water.</p>
<p>Similarly with energy, apart from the environmental
	benefits of producing our own electricity using
	entirely non-polluting methods, we will be ensuring
	our electricity supply in the event that the national
	grid fails.</p>
<p>Because of the drought, more of our food supply
	needs to be transported over longer distances.&nbsp; Combine
	that with rising fuel (and hence transport) costs,
	and the price of fruits and vegetables will continue
	to climb.&nbsp; By growing our own food on-site, we
	will save hundreds of dollars per household per
	week.</p>
<p>To put it simply, if civilization collapses tomorrow,
	at least our community will have a supply of water,
	food and electricity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3.&nbsp; Physical Health</h2>
<p>It is our belief that physical health mainly comes
	from:</p>
<ul>
	<li> drinking plenty of pure, chemical-free water</li>
    <li>eating
		plenty of fresh, whole, organic foods</li>
    <li>breathing
   		plenty of fresh air</li>
    <li>having plenty
    		of space to play in and enjoy the sunshine</li>
</ul>
<p>Our ecovillage will be set up to provide all these
	things and more.&nbsp; Whereas town water contains
	chlorine and other chemicals, our drinking water
	will be highly purified and very healthy.&nbsp; Similarly,
	our food will not contain pesticides
	or herbicides, but will be fresh, whole produce,
	organically  grown in well-designed permaculture
	gardens.&nbsp; Being
	slightly outside the city, and in an environment
	where there is plenty of trees will mean lots of
	sweet fresh air, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.&nbsp; Mental Health</h2>
<p>Happiness and joy mostly come from positive interactions
	with other living things, including humans, plants
	and animals.&nbsp; An ecovillage is designed to provide
	all of these.&nbsp; Living in Silvergreen will mean
	being part of an extended family of around 50 friends.</p>
<p>Unlike
		a typical suburban street where neighbours
	do not even know each other's names, everyone in
	Silvergreen will know each other personally - it will
	be inevitable because of the regular community meetings
	and activities, and the community centre which
	is shared by the whole ecovillage.</p>
<p>Plus, being custodians of a large piece of land,
	and living off the land, will mean regular interaction
	with plants and animals for practically everyone
	in the ecovillage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.&nbsp; Freedom from Survival</h2>
<p>Within the ecovillage, basic items such as food,
	water and electricity are provided virtually
	free.&nbsp; Although residents
	will need to pay rates to cover the costs of infrastructure
	and farming, no-one in the ecovillage will ever
	need to pay for these items separately.&nbsp; The
	cost of producing these fundamental resources is
	integrated into the community.</p>
<p>This means security, peace of mind, happiness and
	harmony.&nbsp; Everyone
	has tough times, but if you live at Silvergreen,
	there will always be plenty of healthy food in
	the cupboard and clean water in the taps.&nbsp; We
	are a family, and everyone gets the basics to live
	healthily, no matter what happens.</p>
<p>This, too,
	is a philosophy we would like to see expressed
	globally.&nbsp; A world where everyone has access
	to plenty of good quality food and water, no matter
	what their situation, is a world at peace.</p>
