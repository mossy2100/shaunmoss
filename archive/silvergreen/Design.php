<h1>Silvergreen Design </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Location</h2>
<p align="left">The Samford Valley is a very beautiful
	location featuring good-natured people, lots of
	trees and wonderful, sweet-smelling fresh air.&nbsp; It
	has been selected mainly because of convenience
	to Brisbane.&nbsp; The
	largest blocks of land around Samford are mostly
	about 16-20 hectares (40-50 acres), which should
	be enough for a small ecovillage.</p>
<p align="left">The challenge of the Samford Valley
	is lack of rainfall - the dams around
	there are currently very low.&nbsp; Fortunately
	our ecovillage design will include all the water
	catchment and recycling technology needed to overcome
	this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Size</h2>
<p>Brisbane is a popular and fast-growing city, and
	large blocks of land are difficult to locate.&nbsp; Samford
	Valley is a compromise - it is only about 20 minutes
	drive from the CBD, yet there are still a number of
	medium sized blocks that will be suitable for this
	development.&nbsp; Most available blocks of an acceptabe
	size in this region are around 16 hectares.&nbsp; Using
	a rule of thumb of one hectare per household, the
	project is expected to include 16 houses plus a community
	centre and other shared facilities.</p>
<p>While this is rather small compared with other ecovillages,
	we believe the project will be very unique, popular
	and worthwhile, and will hopefully inspire other similar
	developments at this scale.</p>
<p>The population for Silvergreen
will therefore only be around 50-60 people, ideally
	about half adults and half children.</p>

	look at a few of the other ecovillages around Oz
	to compare:</p>

<p align="left">As you can see, there is some considerable
	variation in size and population density, with
	an average area per household of about 1.5 ha.&nbsp; The
	last two ecovillages in the list represent the
	extremes.</p>
<p align="left">Silvergreen will therefore be on the
	higher density side, which is hard to avoid on
	a relatively small block of land close to the city,
	because land is more expensive and less available.&nbsp; Even
	so, house lots will be twice as large as a typical
	0.1 ha (&frac14; acre)
	suburban block, and in actual fact, residents will
	each own 1 hectare of land, which is 10 times the
	size of a suburban block.&nbsp; Since capital growth
	comes primarily from appreciation of land value,
	the residents will be well off financially - this
	will be a great investment. &nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">For the sake of a preliminary design,
	we are working with the following figures:</p>
<ul>
	<li>20% of land allocated for housing (3.2 ha)</li>
    <li>30% for
    		common land - that's community buildings,
    	roads, shared infrastructure, permaculture
    	gardens and farmland (4.8 ha)</li>
    <li>50%
    		natural and rehabilitated (8 ha)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Features of the Site</h2>
<p align="left">There
	are a few other features we need to look for in
	an ideal ecovillage site.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>1.&nbsp; Proximity to civilization.</strong>&nbsp; Not
	everyone wants to live out in the sticks, and indeed,
	the whole point of this business is to bring ecovillages
	to the masses.&nbsp; The site must be a short drive
	to the nearest population centre, and ideally near
	a train station or bus stop.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>2.&nbsp; Partly or wholly cleared.</strong>&nbsp; A
	fully vegetated site won't be ideal, because we
	don't want to have to cut down any trees to make
	room for houses.&nbsp; If we select a site that
	has been partly cleared, then rehabilitation of
	the cleared land becomes part of the project.&nbsp; While
	this is an extra expense, it will increase the
	environmental value of the ecovillage - we will be
	able to promote what a positive effect the ecovillage
	has had on the land.&nbsp; Also, if
	there has been some clearing we have more flexibility
	about how to lay out the site.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3.&nbsp; Fresh water sources.</strong>&nbsp; A
	creek, stream, river, lake or dams will really
	add something to the site, providing water for
	irrigation and for animals.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>4.&nbsp; Good soil quality.</strong>&nbsp; We
	need to be able to successfully grow a wide range
	of food on the land, so soil testing will be essential
	before purchasing a site.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>5.&nbsp; Unencumbered.</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.&nbsp; Correctly zoned and
	in harmony with council regulations.</strong> &nbsp; Although
	these obstacles can sometimes be overcome, things
	will go much easier if the land is in the correct
	zone (i.e. residential or semi-rural) and if the
	project does not conflict with local council.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">A Single Builder</h2>
<p align="left">This is something that we will
	be doing which is a little different.&nbsp; Because
	most ecovillages are put together by a group of
	independent like-minded people, rather than a property
	development company, the houses (if they are built
	from scratch) are often quite different.&nbsp; For
	example, at the <a href="http://www.theecovillage.com.au/" target="_blank">Ecovillage
	at Currumbin</a>, the residents
	can build any kind of house they like as long as
	it is within certain design parameters.</p>
<p align="left">However, there are significant
	benefits to be had from using a single builder:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The whole site can be constructed as a single,
		integrated system, making the ecovillage more
		beautiful and harmonious, and streamlining
		the integration of homes with the site's energy,
		water and information systems.</li>
    <li>Leveraging cost benefits through re-use of
    	design elements, drawings, and engineering
    	requirements.</li>
    <li>Cost benefits from bulk-buying of building
    	materials.</li>
    <li>Huge reduction in overheads that would be incurred
    	if architects had to check every
    	design.</li>
    <li>Only having to educate one builder about the
    	design goals of the ecovillage.</li>
</ul>
