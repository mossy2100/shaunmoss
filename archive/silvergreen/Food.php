<h1>Food</h1>
<p>Silvergreen's food supply will come from a combination
	of permaculture, aquaculture and poultry farming.&nbsp; All
	food will be organically grown, without the use
	of herbicides or pesticides. </p>
<p>Like
	energy and water, food will be provided
	on-site by the community, for the community.&nbsp; Of
	course, residents will have the freedom to purchase
	food from other places if they want, but this will
	not be necessary.&nbsp; Ample food for the entire
	community will be grown on site.</p>
<p>While vegetarianism and veganism is growing in popularity,
	and a good case can be made for the environmental
	and health benefits of this type of diet, after
	considerable research we have come to accept that
	many people need and/or desire a certain amount
	of animal protein in their diet.&nbsp; Within the
	ecovillage this will be provided from eggs, chicken
	and fish.</p>
<p>The permaculture gardens will include herbs, vegetables,
	fruits, nuts, and grains.&nbsp; Instead of wheat,
	which many people cannot digest, we will grow oats
	and corn,  and make our own bread from these
	grains.</p>
<p>Chickens in the poultry farm will be fed a healthy
	diet of food scraps and  grains, and will of course
	be free ranging.&nbsp; The aquaculture facility will
	initially grow barramundi, with other fish species
	added as required.&nbsp; Nutrient-dense water
	from the fish tanks will be used on the permaculture
	gardens.</p>
<p>Ideally, residents will choose to maintain the permaculture
gardens, aquaculture tanks and poultry themselves,
	something which could be done with relatively little
	effort.&nbsp; However,
if no-one wants to or has time then staff will be
required, the cost of which will have to be included
in rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Storage and preparation</h2>
<p>The community centre will include a coldroom
	and pantries for food storage, where residents
	can store the harvests and collect their food supplies
	as required.&nbsp; The
	food storage area will be adjacent to a commercial
	kitchen and caf&eacute;/restaurant.&nbsp; This caf&eacute; will
	be spacious, modern and multi-purpose, with AV
	equipment installed, and can be used by residents
	for community feasts,  meetings, presentations,
	seminars, parties, games nights, movie nights or
	whatever.</p>
<p>It would be a pleasant feature if this caf&eacute; was
	preparing meals and beverages much like a regular
	caf&eacute;,
however, this would require staff that would need to
be paid.&nbsp; Whether
or not this is a worthwhile option needs to be decided
by the residents, e.g. if the ecovillage
is mostly populated by working people who have little
time to cook, then having a restaurant on-site would
be extremely handy, and these residents probably would
not mind paying for their meals.&nbsp; In any case,
the cost of meals at the ecovillage caf&eacute; would
be less than regular prices, since only the cost
of wages would need to be covered - the cost of the
actual food, water and electricity is already covered
by rates.</p>
