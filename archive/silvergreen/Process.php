<h1>Development Process </h1>
<p>This page outlines the overall development process
	that will take us from where we are now - a group
	with a great vision - to where we want to be -
	a group living in a fully sustainable community
that we created ourselves.</p>
<p>Our starting point for this overall process comes
	the book by Diane Leafe Christian - &quot;Creating a
	Life Together - Practical Tools to Grow Ecovillages
	and Intentional Communities&quot;.&nbsp; Although

	and some items continue all the way through the
	process. </p>
