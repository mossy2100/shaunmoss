<h1>Development Code </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ecovillage will have a &quot;development code&quot;,
	which will outline various rules for living in the
	ecovillage or developing it further.&nbsp; These rules
	will mainly refer to building design and land use,
	and other items as necessary.&nbsp; For example, dogs
	and cats may only be kept on-site if contained within
	a fenced area.</p>
