<h1>Silvergreen Business Model </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Silvergreen Pty. Ltd. </h2>
<p>An important consideration for any ecovillage is
	designing the most appropriate legal structure.</p>
<p>Probably the best structure for an ecovillage in
	Australia is for the
	ecovillage to  be owned by a company set
	up especially for that purpose.&nbsp; People
	can then own some of the ecovillage by owning shares
	in the company.</p>
<p>Silvergreen P/L will act in a similar way to a
	body corporate, with decisions about the development
being made collectively by owners and tenants.</p>
<p align="left">At Silvergreen everyone
	will own the land in common, since there is no
	subdivision.  House
	lots will only have &quot;soft borders&quot;, i.e.
	there will be an area (average of 2000m<sup>2</sup>)
	allocated for each house, and tenants
	will have the freedom to develop this area as they
	wish, within community guidelines (e.g. much of
	this area will be needed for permaculture, but
	some can be allocated for children, pets or flower
	gardens).&nbsp; However,
	from a legal standpoint all the land on the site
	will be owned by all owners collectively, and there
	will be no clearly defined housing lots in the
	usual sense.</p>
<p align="left">Owners will pay rates to Silvergreen
	P/L, which will then pay rates to council for the
	whole site, as well as take care of any other expenses
	related to maintenance and development.&nbsp; Owners
	will be responsible for their own homes, and they
	may rent out their homes to other parties in the
	usual way, as long as those people agree to comply
	with the policies of the ecovillage.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Tax Benefits</h2>
<p align="left">One of the main advantage of setting
	the ecovillage up as a business is the tax advantages,
	since all of the ecovillage's operating expenses,
	including rates, mortgage repayments, maintenance,
	upgrades and staff wages become tax deductible.&nbsp; As
	this significantly lowers the operating costs of
	the site, this will affect
		all residents directly because their
	rates can also be reduced.</p>
<p align="left">This is a huge advantage over the &quot;usual&quot;
	method of owning a&nbsp; private home and paying rates
	and other expenses with after-tax dollars.</p>
<p align="left">A common method of reducing tax is
	setting up part of the home as a business, which
	allows you to claim a proportion of your  rates,
	maintenance, electricity, water, etc.&nbsp; This technique
	could probably also be applied within the ecovillage
	-  if people are operating businesses from their
	homes within the ecovillage, they could probably
	claim part or all of the rates that they pay to
	Silvergreen. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Generating Income </h2>
<p align="left">In order to demonstrate to the ATO
	that the ecovillage is actually a business, it
	will be necessary to use it to generate an income. </p>
<p align="left">Methods for doing this may include
	hosting seminars, delivering courses, or selling
	electricity, fresh produce or crafts.&nbsp; It
	may even be appropriate to operate the ecovillage
	as a sort of &quot;eco-retreat&quot;, providing a
	variety of services to short-term tenants or holiday-makers
	such as massage, naturopathy, etc.</p>
<p align="left">This
		income can be used to offset costs of maintaining
		the site, or for further development.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Capital Growth</h2>
<p align="left">Although there will be expenses associated
	with the ecovillage, these will be more than offset
	by the capital growth.&nbsp; The plan is to select
	a site that will grow at a higher-than-average
	rate, and almost anywhere in the Samford Valley
	area certainly falls into this category, being
	relatively close to Brisbane and within the much-loved
	region of South-East Queensland.</p>
<p align="left">Most developers go for the highest
	possible density, as high as the council will let
	them.&nbsp; This is because developers make their
	money from property sales, so the more houses
	on a certain area of land, the more money can be
	made.</p>
<p align="left">Property investors, on the other hand,
	make their money from owning property, not selling
	it.&nbsp; The
	situation is almost reversed.&nbsp; Investors know
	that the higher the land component of a property,
	the higher the rate of growth.&nbsp; This
	happens simply because land appreciates in value
	due to lack of supply, yet buildings depreciate
	in value because they get old.&nbsp; Hence,
	investors almost always prefer houses to units,
	because houses come with more land.</p>
<p align="left">As builders of Silvergreen, we will
	be establishing ourselves as <em>developer-investors</em>,
	i.e. we will develop and build the site, but then
	keep most of it for ourselves.&nbsp; This gives a
	double advantage.&nbsp; Sustainable
	development is all about low density, i.e. using
	a large percentage of the land for wildlife conservation
	and agriculture.&nbsp; Since we are not selling the
	properties we develop, we then reap the benefit
	of a higher rate of capital growth due to the higher
	land component.&nbsp; This is a great strategy for
	making a lot of money while also saving the environment,
	and we hope that many other developers will begin
	to adopt this approach.</p>
<p align="left">The development company, AscensionTek,
	will still sell shares in the ecovillage, which
	is functionally equivalent to a traditional developer
	selling house-and-land packages.&nbsp; However, as
	mentioned above, AscensionTek will retain some
	shares in the ecovillage so that it can reap some
	of the capital growth of the site.&nbsp; By using
	this strategy, AscensionTek then has less reason
	to sell shares in the ecovillage at a profit, which
	means lower prices become feasible.&nbsp; The advantage
	here is that the price of shares in the ecovillage
	become comparable to ordinary house-and-land packages,
	yet with multiple bonuses including a high land
	component, higher-than-usual capital growth, free
	electricity, purified water and fresh food, access
	to the community centre, and the fun of living
	in an ecovillage.</p>
