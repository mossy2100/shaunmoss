<h1>Financial Information</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Startup Expenses</h2>
<p>I have begun making estimates about what it will
	cost to start this company properly.&nbsp; Below is
	some information about how I arrived at my estimates,
	which have been collected together in <a href="../doc/GSH_Costings.xls" target="_blank">this
Excel spreadsheet</a>.&nbsp; The main expense in starting
the company will be hardware and software. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hardware (Computers and Printers)</h3>
<p>Naturally, everyone will need a computer, plus the
	company will need at least one server.&nbsp; We will
	also require a colour A4 printer for regular business
	printing, plus an A3 and A1 printer for engineering
	and architectural drawings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Software we need will include Microsoft Office,
	Adobe Creative Suite, Zend Studio, AutoCAD, Revit
	Architecture, and related construction programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Operating Expenses </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Staff</h3>
<p>This will be the largest operating expense, and
	unfortunately unavoidable until robotics and AI
	technology improves.&nbsp; I
	have looked at the minimum team I would need to
	start the company and it looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Me.</strong>&nbsp; Writing, programming,
		planning, researching, management, communications,
		and overseeing the development of the software
		and the ecovillages.</li>
	<li><strong>Planner.</strong>&nbsp; This would be someone with experience
		as a project manager in property development, who
		is familiar with things like financial management,
		scheduling, logistics, infrastructure development,
		council applications, dealing with builders and so
		on.</li>
	<li><strong>Green Architect.</strong>&nbsp; An architect
		with experience and/or training in sustainable development.&nbsp; This
		role would primarily involve development of
		innovative designs for sustainable steel-frame
		houses, house modules, and community buildings.&nbsp; This
		role would involve liasing with structural
		and civil engineers, and builders. </li>
	<li><strong>Programmer.</strong>&nbsp; This person would develop the
		web-based software system as described in the
		<a href="GSH_BizSys.php">Green Steel Homes Business
		System</a>.&nbsp; They
		would be conversant with client and server-side
		web and database programming, including online
		communities and integration of multimedia such
		as video and 3d graphics with the web.</li>
	<li><strong>Draftsperson/3d modeller.</strong>&nbsp; This person would
		mainly work with the architect, but also with the
		programmer, producing drawings and 3d models for
		builders and for the website.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a small team like this, and an ambitious project,
	it is essential to hire top people.&nbsp; For this
	reason I estimate the total cost of salaries for
	this lot for one year to be possibly as high as
	$400k.&nbsp; I understand the need to keep costs down
	during the early stages of the business, but I
	also want the company to have a reputation as
	being generous with its salaries.&nbsp; I think it's
better to start off on the right foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Office Expenses</h3>
<p>I like serviced offices, because then there's a
	whole lot of stuff I don't need to think about,
	like furniture, a receptionist, phone lines, internet
	connections, photocopiers, fax machines, caffeine
	sources, the colour of the carpet and so on.&nbsp; I've
	looked around Brisbane at the rates for services
	offices and a 5-person office in the CBD costs
	about $2500 to $3000 per month.&nbsp; Presumably it
	would be cheaper outside of the CBD.&nbsp; I think
	that, including the costs of telephone, internet,
	photocopying, and other minor incidentals, the
	total office expenses should be maximum $3000 per
	month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Consumables</h3>
<p>There will need to be a budget for day-to-day company
	expenses such as office consumables (printer paper
	and ink, blank CDs, pens and notebooks), petrol
	and other travel expenses, printing (e.g. business
	cards and mail-outs), internet expenses such as
	domain name registration fees and web-hosting,
	company shirts, and the occasional business lunch
	or dinner.&nbsp; This
	should only come to a few hundred dollars per week
	(I have estimated a maximum of $400/week).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Total Business Expenses for Year 1</h2>
<p>Please refer to <a href="../doc/GSH_Costings.xls" target="_blank">this
Excel spreadsheet</a> for details.</p>
<p>The total setup costs are mainly computer hardware
	and software, and come to a total of about $50,000.&nbsp; The
	operating costs for the first year come to about
	$430,000 about 90% of which is salaries.&nbsp; Total
	of around $480,000.&nbsp; This does not include any
	property development costs, this is just setting
	up and running the location.&nbsp; Considering there
	are bound to be things I haven't thought of, it
	is probably sensible to allocate about $500,000
	in total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Subsequent Expenses</h2>
<h3>Consultancy fees </h3>
<p>I'm a big believer in using experts.&nbsp; In
	the long run, it's much cheaper to talk to someone
	who already knows the answer rather than trying
	to figure out everything on your own, because many
	mistakes can be avoided.&nbsp; With a small, 5-person
	team, many tasks that need to be completed by the
	business will need to be outsourced, which will
	be a significant expense.&nbsp; These may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ecovillage consultant.</strong>&nbsp; There
		is an ecovillage consultancy up at Conondale (Sunshine
		Coast) called <a href="http://www.ecologicalsolutions.com.au/" target="_blank">Ecological
		Solutions</a> which has advised several ecovillages
		in the region.&nbsp; These guys will have a lot of
		valuable advice and ideas for us. </li>
	<li><strong>Structural engineering.</strong>&nbsp; It's
		possible that this cost can be avoided by partnering
		with an existing sustainable building company
		that has a product we would like to use in
		our ecovillages (for example <a href="http://www.sustainablebuildings.com.au/default.aspx" target="_blank">Sustainable</a> or <a href="http://www.civicsteelhomes.com.au/" target="_blank">Civic
		Steel Homes</a>). &nbsp; Otherwise, having our new
		building designs approved by engineers can
		cost $tens of thousands.</li>
	<li><strong>Environmental consultant.</strong>&nbsp; We
		will need expert advice on how best to manage a piece
		of land in order to preserve and enhance its natural
		wildlife.&nbsp; This will include a flora and fauna
		survey of the site.</li>
	<li><strong>Horticultural consultant.</strong>&nbsp; If
		the site is being rehabilitated, we will need
		expert advice on the types of native flora that can
		safely be planted.&nbsp; The best people for this
		role may be <a href="http://www.fairhill.com.au/" target="_blank">Fairhill
		Nurseries</a>, native plant experts located on the
		Sunshine Coast.</li>
	<li><strong>Permaculture consultant.</strong>&nbsp; We
		will require advice about how best to organise
		our land for effective food production.&nbsp; Again,
		this may be a role for Ecological Solutions. </li>
	<li><strong>Energy consultant.</strong>&nbsp; Since
		we plan to produce all our own electricity, we will
		need advice about how to integrate our solar panels
		and wind turbines into a site-wide energy grid, and
		how to connect this to the main grid.</li>
	<li><strong>Water and waste management consultant.</strong>&nbsp; We
		will need expert advice on how to correctly manage
		our grey and black water as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Network engineer.</strong>&nbsp; A site-wide
		wireless network and information system is not hard
		to design, but it would still pay to talk to an expert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once
	we've built our first ecovillage we won't necessarily
	need to consult with all these people again,
	especially if we keep good records and document
	our experiences as we go.&nbsp; The consultancy fees
	will (theoretically) be lower with each new project,
	as we gain experience and as we bring more specialists
	into the business.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is hard to estimate the total
	cost of these consultancy fees.&nbsp; I would envisage
	on the order of $50k for the first ecovillage,
	and declining from there.</p>
