<h1>Management Team </h1>

<p>The management team is currently comprised of a
	grand total of one person, i.e. me.&nbsp; (This is
	a work in progress.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Shaun Moss</h2>
<p>I'm 35 years old, live in Annerley, Brisbane, Queensland,
	Australia, and am the creator of AscensionTek,
	Green Steel Homes and <a href="<?= $SilvergreenUrl ?>">Silvergreen</a>.</p>
<p>My primary formal qualification is a Bachelor of
	Science in Engineering Maths and Computer Science
	from the University of Queensland, completed between
	1988 and 1992.&nbsp; I
	have also completed studies in Computer Systems
	Engineering, Information Systems Engineering and
	Mechatronics Engineering, and am a qualified personal
	trainer with the Australian Institute of Fitness.</p>
<p>Most of my employment has been in
	the IT industry, with commercial programming experience
	beginning at the age of 16.&nbsp; This
	was writing an advanced computer program for a
	steel building company which generated orthographic
	and isometric drawings, parts lists and accurate
	quotes.&nbsp; Since then, I have written software
	for two other steel building companies, which including
	creating colour perspective views of steel
	buildings, and online design of modular steel-frame
	kit homes.&nbsp; I
	also sold steel buildings for two companies.</p>
<p>I have designed and built software and databases
	for a wide range of industries, in four countries:
Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK.&nbsp; For
about 3 years I wrote software for a real estate company
which further developed my interest in property.</p>
<p>At
		various times I have also worked as a fast-food
	server, computer technician, door-to-door salesperson,
	sales trainer, manager of&nbsp;a direct sales company,
	storeperson, gaming machine attendant in a casino,
	computer salesperson, tutor, researcher, lecturer,
	video editor, web designer, graphic designer, drummer,
	personal trainer, fencer, painter, draftsperson,
	industrial designer, and project officer in the
	engineering workshop at Mount Isa Mines.</p>
<p>The offspring of an inventor-entrepreneur and a
	new age travel buff, I have a knack for research,
	design and creative problem-solving.&nbsp; I
	love science and engineering and am incredibly
	excited about the 21st century, during which I
	anticipate unprecedented advances in human consciousness,
	technology and design.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in the
	power of the human mind, advanced healing techniques,
	 metaphysics and &quot;alternative&quot;
	physics.&nbsp; I'm
	a student of the Law of Attraction and co-facilitate
	the <a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/306/" target="_blank">Brisbane
	Law of Attraction Meetup Group</a>.&nbsp; I
	like writing, drawing, designing, research, planning,
	singing, exercise, travelling, taking photos of
	animals, collecting coins and books, listening
	to funky tunes, watching movies and generally having
	a laugh.</p>
<h3>Management experience</h3>
<p>I have run 3 businesses to date.&nbsp; Firstly, I worked freelance
	for 2 years as a home tutor in maths, science and
		computers.</p>
<p>From 1992-1994, I was Trainer and Assistant
	Manager in the Brisbane
	office of World Wholesaling
	Industries for about one year.&nbsp; Another year
	was spent working with this organisation in the
	Netherlands, which included starting my own direct
	sales and marketing company, called &quot;Quicksilver
	Marketing&quot;,
	in Rotterdam.&nbsp; This involved management of a
	team of about 30 people, including
	all recruiting and training.</p>
<p>More recently, I ran my own successful web development
	business called Earth Multimedia from 2001-2005.&nbsp; This
	was a sole trader business; I did not employ anyone
	although I did outsource work occasionally.</p>
