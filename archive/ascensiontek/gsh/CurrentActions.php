<h1>Current Actions (July 2007)</h1>

<p>This page explains
	what we are currently working on to get the company
	up and running as soon as possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Website and Business Plan </strong></p>
<p>This website and business plan receive ongoing
	development.&nbsp; Our main focus at this time is
	continued development of the business plan, and promoting
	it to potential investors.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Building Design</strong></p>
<p>We are currently developing a range of house designs,
	including the floor plans, materials, and integrated
	technology.&nbsp; These need to be developed to the
	point where they can be passed to an architect
	or building designer for development into saleable
	products.&nbsp; We
	 have already found a building designer/civil engineer
	to take on this role.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Research </strong></p>
<p>Developing the building design requires research
	into the best materials and technologies, and calculating
	the overall cost of the homes.&nbsp; Recently we
	have focused on the water sub-system, and our next
	goal is to complete a preliminary design of the
	energy sub-system.&nbsp; We are also learning as much
	as possible about ecovillages, construction and
	property development, and are actively engaged
	in market research.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Financial Estimates</strong></p>
<p>This includes developing cost estimates for setting
	up the company, building a Green Steel Home, and
	building Silvergreen.&nbsp; It also includes developing
	cash-flow projections in co-operation with our
	accountant. </p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Finding a location</strong></p>
<p>We are currently looking for a suitable location
	from which to operate the business.&nbsp; This will
	probably be in West End, and will have enough space
	for at least 10-12 people.</p>
