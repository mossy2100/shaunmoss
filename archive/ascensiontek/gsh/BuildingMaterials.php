<h1>Building Materials</h1>
<p>The frame, of course, will be solid steel.&nbsp; As
	far as materials for wall, roof and floor cladding,
	this will be an area of ongoing research into the
	most suitable environmentally-friendly materials.&nbsp; Customers
	may be given a range of options here.</p>
<p>These are the materials I currently
		favour:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Colorbond
		steel from Lysaght, which comes in a <a href="http://www.bluescopesteel.com.au/index.cfm?objectID=DFDB8239-A758-3671-57DD796DABABE6FA" target="_blank">range
		of profiles</a>, for external wall and roof
		cladding. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.enviroboardcorporation.com/" target="_blank">Enviro
    		Board</a>, made from highly compressed straw,
		can be used for internal or external cladding,
		roofs, ceilings, or door cores. &nbsp; (Only
		problem - this is not yet available
		in Australia.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows will be supplied by <a href="http://www.pilkington.com.au/" target="_blank">Pilkington</a>,
	a company well-known in the building industry as
	a leader in sustainability.</p>
<p>Fascia and guttering will most likely be supplied
by Lysaght.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rainharvesting.com.au/blue_mountain_all_steel_gutter_mesh.asp" target="_blank">Blue
Mountain</a> gutter mesh supplied by <a href="http://www.rainharvesting.com.au/" target="_blank">Rain
Harvesting</a>.</p>
