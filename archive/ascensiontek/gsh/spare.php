<p>During the early plans for this company I was going
	to begin with ecovillage projects and use a 3rd party
	builder for at least the first one or two projects.&nbsp; In
	fact, I was going to use other companies for practically
	the entire ecovillage construction - AscensionTek
	would have been responsible for software development,
	project management, marketing and sales.&nbsp; I did
	not want to tackle construction services until we
	had some cash flow and experience, and besides, I
	saw ecovillages as the primary product rather than
	sustainable homes.</p>
<p>However, now I have decided to provide sustainable
	homes first, and develop ecovillage projects later.&nbsp; The
	homes will go on sale from early next year, and construction
	of our first ecovillage will commence in 2009 (although
	the interest group will be meeting regularly before
	the end of 2007).</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this change in tactics:</p>
<p><strong>Not everyone wants to live in an ecovillage
		- but we all need to be living sustainably.</strong></p>
<p>Even if ecovillage living is proved to be much healthier,
	it simply isn't practical for everyone, and especially
	not in the city where population density has to be
	higher.&nbsp; Large blocks of land are scarce or expensive
	in and around Brisbane, which means that ecovillages
	will have to be some distance from the city.&nbsp; But
	this is too much of an obstacle for most people, as
	is feeling obliged to contribute to the development
	of a large site, or to participate in community lifestyle.</p>
<p>If someone was given the choice between buying a
	regular home on its own lot, versus buying a share
	in an ecovillage, only a few people in today's market
	would choose the ecovillage.&nbsp; However, given
	a choice between a regular home or a long-lasting
	sustainable home, many people in today's market would
	choose the sustainable home.&nbsp; Offering single
	home construction greatly lowers the barriers to sustainable
	living.</p>
<p><strong>More cash-flow, sooner.</strong></p>
<p>For the same reasons, we can expect a much higher
	quantity of sales of sustainable homes on single lots
	compared with homes in ecovillages.&nbsp; Plus, it
	will take much less time before we can offer them
	as a product.</p>
<p><strong>No need to use a 3d party builder in our
		ecovillages.</strong></p>
<p>This means we won't have to compromise on design,
	or to pay retail prices for the ecovillage buildings.&nbsp; When
	we begin constructing ecovillages in 2009, we will
	have an awesome house design and streamlined construction
	system ready to go.</p>
