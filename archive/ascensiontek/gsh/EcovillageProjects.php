<h1>Ecovillage Projects</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Ecovillages?</h2>
<p>Ecovillages represent a truly tremendous business
	opportunity with multiple advantages:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Ecovillages are good for Earth.</strong></h3>
<p>Ecovillages have been proven over the centuries
	as an effective approach to sustainable habitation
	of Earth. Development of new technologies in recent
	years have made ecovillages a much more viable,
	accessible and popular alternative.&nbsp; They reduce
	the load on national water and energy infrastructure,
	and respect, conserve and often rehabilitate the
	natural environment.</p>
<p>Ecovillages are a way of living in
	harmony with Earth, but also with each other.&nbsp; People
	rarely become isolated within an ecovillage because
	of shared goals, activities and facilities, minimising
	issues
	such as depression which are becoming commonplace
	in modern society.&nbsp; This
	type of environment therefore also leads naturally
	to improved physical health, since most physical
	ailments are a result of underlying mental or emotional
	problems.&nbsp; Another
	way that ecovillages contribute directly to the
	health of its residents is through the production
	of fresh, whole organic foods.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Ecovillages and sustainable housing are
		profitable, and increasingly in demand.</strong></h3>
<p>Climate change has brought environmental issues
	to the forefront of the public consciousness, where
	they are likely to remain for decades.&nbsp; The
	general public is beginning to realise the need
	for more sustainable habitation practices, and
	there is a definite market shift towards environmental
	products and services. &nbsp; At the same time, population
	growth and industrialisation in developing nations,
	plus mass displacement caused by rising sea levels,
	is leading to increased demand globally for high-quality,
	safe, sustainable housing solutions. Hence we can
	expect our products and services to be in high
	demand for at least the next few decades, and probably
	indefinitely.</p>
<p>We improve our early profitability by beginning
	in Queensland, the fastest growing state in Australia.&nbsp; Most
	Queensland millionaires built their wealth through
	property investment and/or development.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Ecovillages are good terrestrial analogues
for moonbases or marsbases.</strong></h3>
<p>While most people would probably not consider this
	to be a particularly important advantage, for AscensionTek,
	it is.</p>
<p>There are many common elements between space settlements
	and ecovillages. Like a moonbase or marsbase, an
	ecovillage is a highly independent community which
	produces most or all of its energy, food, and water.
	Both space settlements and ecovillages require
	high energy and water efficiency, water recycling,
	energy production, and small-scale agriculture,
	and each includes shared facilities for things
	like health-care, equipment maintenance, community
	meals, and scientific research. Each also represents
	a small population living and working together,
	thus many of the same human factors issues exist,
	such as consensus decision-making and conflict
	resolution.</p>
<p>Hence, gaining experience with ecovillage design,
	construction and operation over the next 3 or more
	decades will generate valuable insight into moonbase
	and marsbase design, both at the level of the built
	and natural environments, and in the psychological
	factors relevant to small integrated communities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Our First Ecovillage </h2>
<p><a href="<?= $SilvergreenUrl ?>">Silvergreen</a> is
	our first ecovillage project, and has already begun.&nbsp; Ecovillages
	are usually put together by a group of like-minded
	individuals, and therefore do not require a large
	amount of business resources to create (although
	of course this is an advantage!).&nbsp; It means that
	the Silvergreen project can be started now, even
	before the company has sponsorship.</p>
<p>This initial project will help to catalyse the development
	of a core design and management team, as well as
	solutions for sustainable buildings and community
	design.</p>
<p>Because
	the house construction component of the company
	does not yet exist, the current plan for Silvergreen
	is to use a 3rd party builder, and consultants
	for other parts of the design as required.&nbsp; This
	first project will be a big learning experience
	for the company, in which we use mainly outside
	advisors.&nbsp; However, with each successive project
	we will be able to rely more on our own knowledge
	and experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Progressive Challenges</h2>
<p>Our strategy for the ecovillage development part
	of the business is to progressively increase
	the difficulty of our projects, in terms of size
	and/or habitability challenges.&nbsp; This
	is done for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To show that the ecovillage concept can be extended
		to practically every corner of Earth.</li>
    <li>To show that ecovillage design principles are
    	applicable at every scale, from
    	single-house lots to cities.</li>
    <li>As a steady progression towards moonbases and
    	marsbases.</li>
</ol>
<p>This progression must be managed with a degree of
	restraint - each project must be evaluated for
	its economic feasibility and our tendency will
	be to avoid risk as much as possible.&nbsp; However,
	with each project our confidence and knowledge
	will increase, as will our ability to make challenging
	projects successful.</p>
<p>The progression might go something like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Small ecovillages with 10-100 houses.</li>
    <li>Large ecovillages with 100-1000 houses.</li>
    <li>Urban and suburban ecovillages within cities. </li>
    <li>&quot;Ecotowns&quot;, with as many as 100,000 houses.</li>
    <li>Ecovillages and ecotowns in the desert - important
    	for Australia and elsewhere, offering challenges
   	in local production of food and water.</li>
    <li>  &quot;Mining ecotowns&quot;  - remote but
    	sustainable mining communities.&nbsp; Remote
    	mining towns are a good analogue for future
    	moonbases and marsbases.</li>
    <li>Ecovillages and ecotowns in polar regions -
    	challenges in environment control (see <a href="../bizplan/FutureDev.php">Phase
    	2: Future Developments</a>). </li>
    <li>&quot;Ecocities&quot; with populations of 1,000,000 or
    	more.&nbsp; Planned
    	cities designed around ecovillage principles.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment it may seem hard to imagine that one
	company could consider taking on this range of
	projects.&nbsp; However, over a 100 year period, with
	continually developing technology, locations
	around the world, and a great system, this is exactly
	what will happen.</p>
