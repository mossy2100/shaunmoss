<h1>Shaun's Blog</h1>
<h2>Wednesday 12 September 2007 </h2>
<p>It's been three weeks since last update, and there
	have been a lot of changes in that time.</p>
<p>Firstly, I had no internet for two weeks, because
	my modem broke and it took TPG that long to replace
	it.&nbsp; I
	know!&nbsp; I had a serious case of BSA (Bandwidth
	Separation Anxiety).&nbsp; But that's the main reason
	why the site has sat unattended for a while.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have started a new job, as &quot;Internet
	Development Manager&quot; for a recording studio/music
	label called <a href="http://www.keytone.com" target="_blank">Keytone</a>.&nbsp; It's
	a really great company, on track to be the best
	studio in Brisbane.&nbsp; At
	the moment there is still sawdust and wires everywhere
	while the audio engineers build the
	studio, but it is nearly done.&nbsp; My job is to
	build a kick-ass e-commerce website, which will
	allow people to purchase songs, albums, samples
	and merchandise online.</p>
<p>What this does mean, of course, is that my business
	idea did not get funded yet, and now AscensionTek
	will have to take a backseat for a while, since
	the new role is very demanding time-wise.&nbsp; To
	be perfectly honest I have lost some enthusiasm
	for the idea of running my own company.&nbsp; Despite
	my ideas in this vein, I no longer believe it's
	my true purpose, at least, not at this time - otherwise
	I would surely have made more progress.&nbsp; I have
	reluctantly come to accept the truth that most
	of the knowledge needed to build a company from
	scratch, or to become a successful property developer,
	I just plain don't have.</p>
<p>So, I am no longer looking for investment in my
	company; at least, not until I redevelop the idea.&nbsp; My
	skills are as a writer, graphic designer and web
	developer, so if I am to build a business, these
	are the skills it should be based on.</p>
<p>This means I will have to completely redevelop aspects
	of this website - but at least I can now throw
	caution to the wind insofar as what I put up here.&nbsp; Part
	of my life is connected with ETs, conspiracy theories
	and spiritual concepts, which I have avoided expressing
	online in case a potential investor read about
	them and decided I was too &quot;left of centre&quot; to
	be taken seriously.&nbsp; However,
	that makes little difference at this point, so
	I will probably post some articles about these
things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tuesday, 21 August 2007</h2>
<p>Okay, I know I've been slack on the blog front,
	but a lot has been happening.</p>
<p>Just to tidy up where I was at the end of the last
	entry, I should explain about Empowernet.&nbsp; Basically,
	these guys use advanced selling techniques (the
	company actually used to be called Sales Pursuit)
	to sell seminars and related products.&nbsp; They
	invite people along to free events, such as the
	Real Estate Mastery seminar which I went to, and
	the presenters on-sell products from the stage.&nbsp; And,
	yes, I fell for it, signing up with them for further
	seminars and business opportunities.&nbsp; Fortunately
	I came to my senses and realised what was going
	on just in time, before any monetary transfer.&nbsp; Well,
	we live and learn.&nbsp; There
	seems to be a lot of people these days selling
	the idea of easy wealth for a few
	thousand bucks a pop.&nbsp; It
	pays to be cautious.</p>
<p>My theory is that everyone's life is challenging,
	whether they have money or not - it just depends
	what lessons they are here to learn.&nbsp; For my
	part, I just want to serve God and Earth as best
	I can, and, considering my
	current skills and position, I believe the best
	way for me to do that right now is to build ecovillages
	and websites.</p>
<p>Last Thursday was the first meeting of <a href="http://ecna.org.au/xoops/" target="_blank">ECNA</a> in
	Brisbane, which was attended by 7 men and zero
	women.&nbsp; Hopefully
	the population of both genders will increase over
	time.&nbsp; But we had a great discussion.&nbsp; Being
	the first meeting it was somewhat unstructured,
	but we got to introduce ourselves and share some
	of our ideas.&nbsp; I was glad that everyone
	present had some considerable
	knowledge and energy to contribute to the idea
	of building ecovillages.&nbsp; I mean, it wasn't just
	a bunch of hippies sitting around, sharing a spliff,
	going &quot;yeah, man, ecovillages are cool...&quot;&nbsp; There
	were two very experienced ecological builders
	present, a representative from <a href="http://www.salahomes.com.au/" target="_blank">SALA
	Homes</a>, lecturers in
	sustainability from <a href="http://qut.edu.au/" target="_blank">QUT</a>,
	Steph Zannakis from <a href="http://www.spiral.org.au/" target="_blank">Spiral</a>,
	and Russell Austerberry from ECNA.</p>
<p>This was followed by the first Silvergreen meeting
	on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; Attended by 8 would-be
	ecovillagers, the meeting was very interesting
	and productive, with a great cross-section of personalities
	and skills.&nbsp; We shared our notions about ecovillages
and reasons for wanting to participate, and discussed
a few basics such as where the ecovillage would be
located and how big it should be.&nbsp; One of the
most important changes to Silvergreen as it stood at
that point was that we unanimously agreed to make it
a &quot;full-scale&quot; ecovillage, with at least
100 homes.</p>
<p>Another Silvergreen meeting last night with just
	a few of us served to develop ideas for consensus
	decision-making processes and the overall process
	for developing Silvergreen, or indeed, any ecovillage.&nbsp; We'll
	be having another Silvergreen meeting next month
	to discuss processes, which we generally agree
	is the most important first step.</p>
<p>I see now that my main role (at this early stage
	anyway) is to develop websites, since this is my
	area of expertise.&nbsp; Other companies such as SALA
	and <a href="http://www.greenedge.org/" target="_blank">GreenEdge</a> are
	much more knowledgeable about other aspects of
	ecovillage design and development, so
	I have started working with the idea of joint
	ventures, which seems the best way to combine the
	skills of different organisations into cohesive
	and effective solutions.&nbsp; The concepts
	and plans for ecovillages.com.au and ecovillages.net.au
	have firmed up considerably, and these are beginning
	to look like really great projects, both in terms
	of business, and positive effect on the environment
	and community.&nbsp; These
	websites have become the current main focus, as
	they now appear to be the most effective way to
	begin generating income for the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tuesday, 7 August 2007</h2>
<p>The business is progressing extremely well - especially
	over the past few days!</p>
<p>My goal for last week was to get the <a href="<?= $SilvergreenUrl ?>">Silvergreen
	website</a> online, which I achieved, uploading about
	midday on Friday.&nbsp; The rest of that afternoon
	was spent at the HIA Building and Renovation Expo,
	and boy, was that fun!&nbsp; I was like a kid in a
	candy store, checking out all the latest environmental
	technologies, sustainable building materials, security
	systems, kitchens, appliances, home theatres, etc.,
	etc.&nbsp; It
	was great!&nbsp; I also joined the HIA while I was
	there, as they had a special show offer, and it
	was something I had planned to do. </p>
<p>It was no accident that the Silvergreen website
	was launched that morning.&nbsp; I spoke to a lot
	of different people in the construction game, and
	was able to give many of them business cards with
	the Silvergreen URL scrawled on the back.&nbsp; A
	funny thing happened that day - instead of being
	someone who <em>wants</em> to be a property developer,
	I started to actually feel that I <em>am</em> one.&nbsp; The
	Law of Attraction was working overtime, and by
	the end of that day I really felt different about
	myself.&nbsp; Was
	I a web programmer?&nbsp; No way!&nbsp; I was a property
	developer with an interesting ecovillage project
	underway, and a member of the
	Housing Industry of Australia. </p>
<p>The weekend was even more massive in terms of energy
	shifts.&nbsp; I had manifested a free invitation to
	the Real Estate Mastery seminar, held by a company
	called Empowernet - two
	days, each from about 9am to 9pm, of intense education
	about property investment.&nbsp; By Sunday night I
	felt extremely empowered, motivated and activated,
	with loads of ideas about how best to structure
	the company, and the ecovillages.&nbsp; Property investment
	strategies aren't all that complicated - much simpler
	than most computer programs! - yet capable of taking
	someone with the diligence and courage to apply
	them to great heights of wealth and success.&nbsp; By
	the end of the seminar I knew that once AscensionTek
	gets just a small amount of momentum, it will grow
	and grow.&nbsp; My goal is to get control of as much
	land as possible, to ensure that it is developed
	sustainably - and now I know how to control the
	maximum amount of property with the least amount
	of dollars.</p>
<p>On Monday, I registered two new domain names: <strong>ecovillages.com.au</strong>	and <strong>ecovillages.net.au</strong>.&nbsp; Ecovillages.com.au
	will be the commercial site, where the company
	will offer all the products and services necessary
	to develop ecovillages, including consultancy,
	design services, technology, training, human resources,
	land, construction and management.&nbsp; Ecovillages.net.au
	will be the site where people can set
	up their own ecovillage projects, with all the
	information, tutorials, articles, e-books, communications
	tools and software necessary to do this
	successfully.&nbsp; Also, yesterday
	I came in contact with <a href="http://ecna.org.au/xoops/" target="_blank">ECNA,
	the Ecovillage and Co-housing Network of Australia</a>,
	and some of their members who are living in Brisbane.
	 They are great people and I'm sure we'll be
	working together in the future as this movement
	unfolds.</p>
<p>Today I met with a consultant from EmpowerNet to
	discuss some of their products.&nbsp; They offer an
	Advanced Real Estate Mastery course, which I have
	signed up for, and which takes place in November.&nbsp; I
	am also considering purchasing a franchise from
	them, to become an affiliate - I will find out
	more about this opportunity on Thursday night.&nbsp; It
	may seem strange that I would consider this, but
	the problem is this - I have this vision for an
	awesome, exciting business, and the knowledge about
	how to make it super successful, but I don't yet
	have the capital to take it to the next level.&nbsp; I
	need to start generating cash flow this month,
	but to take an ordinary job at this stage would
	be pointless.&nbsp; This
	business opportunity might be just what I need.&nbsp; As
	well as generating significant unlimited income,
	more importantly it will also connect me with a
	lot of very positive, motivated
	and successful people that have a huge amount of
	knowledge about wealth creation and property investment,
	and open up all kinds of doors.&nbsp; An
	instant team - and a really good one at that!</p>
<p>The Law of Attraction really works,
		and watching these elements come together day-by-day
	is very exciting.&nbsp; Watch this space!&nbsp; AscensionTek
	is on track to being one of the most interesting,
	important and successful property development companies
	of the 21st century!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Saturday, 28 July 2007</h2>
<p>The business is progressing.&nbsp; It has become
	clear over the past week that I have been spending
	too much time on details and working in areas that
	are not my fort&eacute;, which is just plain inefficient.&nbsp; My
	particular skill is in expressing the broader vision,
	so that is where I should keep my focus.&nbsp; In
	other words, I will not be starting a water technology
	company or even a steel-frame
	construction company (not yet, anyway).&nbsp; I
	have learnt that there are other housing companies
	(e.g.
	<a href="http://www.salahomes.com.au/" target="_blank">SALA
	Homes</a>) that have much more evolved building
	designs.&nbsp; Therefore, I have brought my focus
	back to ecovillages.&nbsp; This website is yet to
	reflect that change, however a new website especially
	for Silvergreen is being developed which will be
	online soon.&nbsp; Our first Silvergreen meeting has
	also been scheduled, for 18 August.</p>
<p>Also, I am acutely aware that I have been neglecting
	the space development aspect of the company, which
	is important to keep putting energy into to ensure
	that this doesn't become an &quot;Earth-only&quot; program.&nbsp; Repair
	and rehabilitation of Earth is merely a stepping
	stone on the way to Mars, and it is very important
	to remain aware of this greater challenge.&nbsp; I
	have now allocated one day per week  specifically
	for developing the company's space colonisation
	strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;Team&quot; remains a nebulous concept,
	but there are signs of crystallisation, as I am
	forming some great new friendships with people
	experienced in property investment, real estate
	and property development.&nbsp; The
	Law of Attraction is at work, and with every effort
put into the business I see new manifestations.</p>
<p>A lot of companies have started promoting that
	they are
	&quot;climate neutral&quot; or &quot;greenhouse neutral&quot;.&nbsp; My
	response is - big whoop.&nbsp; When you can say &quot;my
	company actively improves the environment&quot; or
	is
	&quot;climate positive&quot;, by all means, then make
	a big show of it.&nbsp; Humans
	have been damaging the planet for centuries, it
	is not going to solve anything to be &quot;climate neutral&quot;.&nbsp; We
	need to give back, a lot.&nbsp; One company I spoke
	with yesterday (Wyndham Hotels and Resorts) assured
	me that because I had agreed to listen to a 90
	minute presentation on time-sharing in exchange
	for 5 nights accommodation (hehe, yeah I know.
&nbsp;	I'm one of those people who are nice to telemarketers,
which only encourages them.&nbsp; Sorry!), they would
plant a tree on my behalf.&nbsp; Now,
that's climate positive.</p>
<p>I have not brought much spirituality into
	this website so far, because I was concerned that
	many of my friends in the space community would
	not understand or respect it.&nbsp; However, I have
	changed my mind about this.&nbsp; God, faith, and
	the so-called &quot;Law of Attraction&quot; are playing
	important roles in the manifestation of this
	dream, and it is hard for me to express myself
	properly without including these concepts.&nbsp; In
	any case, spirituality is becoming better understood
	from a scientific perspective and more widely accepted
	every day.&nbsp; A
	taste of this spiritual aspect of the company can
	be found in the new article, <a href="articles/JesusAndLOA.php">Jesus
	and the Law of Attraction</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Sunday, 22 July 2007</h2>
<p>I feel the need to be updating the site more frequently
	than what I have been (so far I have only done
	one update since the site was first launched),
	which is why I have added this page.&nbsp; It should
	allow me to post regular, less formal, updates
	(1-2 times per week) without too much fuss.</p>
<p>After the last update, about 2 weeks ago, I went
	away for one week of camping.&nbsp; My friends and
	I travelled to the Bunya Mountains, Canarvorn Gorge,
	and the gemfields near Rubyvale in central Queensland.&nbsp; I
	was reminded once again what a beautiful and diverse
	part of the world we are living in, and the importance
	of preserving that.</p>
<p>Hiking in the Bunyas, one of the main things we
	noticed was the scarcity of animal life, and in
	fact, despite the relatively dense rainforest growth,
	the only non-human creature we encountered was
	a single scrub turkey.&nbsp; Perhaps
	this could be attributed to the intense cold, however,
	we did discover later, at the information centre,
	that birdlife in the Bunyas is slowly disappearing.&nbsp; Yet
	another reminder of the state of our planet.&nbsp; In
	any case, the Bunya Mountains is quite close to
	Brisbane (2-3 hours drive) and camping is free
	- highly recommended.</p>
<p>Over the past week I have continued researching
	water technologies for residential homes.&nbsp; I
	am pleased to report that Australia seems to be
	at the forefront of residential water management
	technology - perhaps unsurprisingly.&nbsp; Because
	of the need to begin generating income as soon
	as possible, I am now toying with the idea of 
	starting a company that installs water systems,
	since this is such a pressing problem in Australia
	at this time, and hence a good business opportunity.&nbsp; There
	are many companies with water-related technologies,
	but none offering
	fully integrated systems.&nbsp; A water technology
	company could be a stepping stone towards Green
	Steel Homes, which I am finding a much more challenging
	project to initiate than I had imagined.</p>
<p>As yet I have not had any
		interest in GSH from investors.&nbsp; A friend has
		suggested that this is because I do not yet
		have enough experience in the industry to be
		taken seriously, which I suppose is fair enough.&nbsp; Therefore,
		I need to find other pathways towards this
		goal that perhaps do not require investors
		- a water technology company may be a step
		along this pathway, since this is much easier
		and should be profitable enough so that I can
		build it up without requiring outside investment.</p>
<p>However, before diverting too much time into a water
	technology business I also feel the need to complete
	the preliminary building design for Green Steel
	Homes, so that it does not sit there unfinished.&nbsp; Hence,
	the next update should summarize the building design,
	which is now in its own section.&nbsp; Perhaps this
	will trigger some investment?&nbsp; Who knows - I
	continue to apply the Law of Attraction, and visualising
	a great and successful 21st century construction
	company!</p>
<p>Also, I have been given some encouraging information
	about property development from a developer I have
	recently met.&nbsp; Apparently banks are much more
	likely to lend large amounts rather than small
	amounts for property development.&nbsp; My best theory
	is that this is because developers who conceive
	of larger projects are generally more business
	oriented.&nbsp; Since
	I expect Silvergreen to cost about $7-8 million,
	this may be a large enough project for a bank to
	be excited about funding, and it may not be necessary
	to postpone it at all, especially while ecovillages
	are flavour of the month.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pressing need at this time is to
	begin building a team.&nbsp; The above ramblings
	should indicate that there is a lot of work to
	do with designing and planning, and I am finding
	it hard to do all of it myself.&nbsp; My original
	plan was to solicit investment first, and then
	hire the necessary people - however, if I can begin
	building a team first, then I think the income
	will appear much quicker, not only because of the
	extra people-power, but for the enhanced focus,
	motivation, synergy and fun.&nbsp; So
	- if you are interested in what I am trying to
	achieve with AscensionTek and Green Steel Homes,
	if you dream of having a big
	positive effect on the planet, and if you are smart
	and honest, then please
	<a href="contact.php">contact me</a>.&nbsp; I
	am in need of an assistant manager, building designers
	or green architects, plumbers, electricians, programmers,
	permaculturists, and others.&nbsp; Most
	importantly: thinkers!&nbsp; I am very generous and
	once the dollars start flowing there will definitely
	be plenty for everyone.</p>
