<h1>Education</h1>

<p>As well as property development projects, AscensionTek
	is interested in supporting education for the next
	generation of scientists and engineers.&nbsp; Our
	focus will be on applied science and engineering
	specifically aimed at improving the quality of
	human life.&nbsp; It
	is our belief that an enlightened society develops
	its environment for the benefit of subsequent generations,
	and that the
	legacy we should be striving to leave for our descendants
	is one of harmonious multi-planetary
	life.</p>
<p>Our educational goals include the
	eventual construction of the <a href="ice/">Institute
	for Colonisation and
	Exploration</a> in Antarctica.&nbsp; Other ideas include
	the development of &quot;Space School&quot;, an online
	science, engineering, maths, technology and design
	school which caters for students of all ages from
	around the world, and the production of the <em>Space
	Colonisation Handbook</em>, an online evolving e-textbook
	containing knowledge, plans and ideas for developing
	human colonies throughout the System and potentially
	beyond.&nbsp; Some of the articles on this website
	will be included in the SCH, and submissions are
	welcome.</p>
