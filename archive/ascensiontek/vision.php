<h1>The Vision </h1>
<p>The goal for AscensionTek is to have as large a
	positive effect (from a human perspective) as possible
	on the planets Earth, Luna (the Moon) and Mars.&nbsp; We
	aim to build up a large, profitable company which
	will affect the way things are done,
	especially with regard to human habitation of Earth,
	wildlife conservation, resource production and
	management, environmental management and health.&nbsp; Our
	ambition is to help Earth through its current transition,
	and into a new state of peace, harmony, humour
	and adventure.&nbsp; We also intend to participate
	as fully as possible in the emerging space colonisation
	movement, with plans to develop bases on both Luna
	and Mars, and in Earth orbit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>We foresee a world where ....</strong></em></p>
<ul>
	<li>... people laugh a lot. </li>
    <li>... everyone is friends;
					where
					it is possible for a person to
    	travel to any other part of Earth unhindered -
    	and where every part of Earth is safe.&nbsp; What
    	were once national borders will no longer have
    	any political significance, even though they may
			still describe geographical areas.</li>
    <li>... life is everywhere.&nbsp; Where
		animals and plants can be seen everywhere.&nbsp; The
		places that were once deserts will be green
		and lush.&nbsp; The oceans will be brimming with
		life, and the skies will be full of birds of
		all kinds.</li>
    <li>... Earth is stable.&nbsp; Where the environment
    	and the group consciousness has reached such
    	a state of calm that people can live in practically
    	any part of the world in complete safety.</li>
    <li>... people live
		in harmony with each other and the Earth.&nbsp; Where
		our methods of habitation improve the surrounding
		land and enhance conditions for wildlife.</li>
    <li>... our industry functions
	in harmony with the environment.&nbsp; Where important
	materials such as metals, cement, glass and plastics
	are manufactured in a sustainable and environmentally
	harmonious way that includes planned recycling at
	product end-of-life.</li>
    <li>... good, vibrant health is the norm.&nbsp; Where
    	every person knows the value of fresh, whole,
    	organic foods and has access to an abundance
    	of these foods for free.&nbsp; Where pure clean
    	water is also available for free, in abundance,
    	to everyone.&nbsp; Where
    	play and adventure fill the role of exercise.</li>
    <li>... the creative power of the mind is common
    	knowledge.&nbsp; Where
    	people know to control their thoughts because
    	of their awareness of their role in creation
    	of the planetary environment.</li>
    <li>... everyone understands that we are
    	all just reflections of each other, and thus
    	the only rational behaviour is to treat each
    	other with love, kindness and respect.</li>
    <li>... there is an atmosphere of excitement and
    	freedom stimulated by the new frontier
    	- space.&nbsp; Where
    	people have the opportunity to travel to the
    	Moon, Mars and many other worlds, to experience
    	the adventure of new frontiers and participate
    	in creating amazing new communities in space.</li>
    <li>... people no longer have to work for their
    	survival, because all basic needs are
    	provided by automated systems.&nbsp; Where
    	people only engage in activities which bring
    	them pleasure - if they do choose to work,
    	it will be at their hobbies.&nbsp; Where many
    	people will simply travel, create, teach, entertain
    	and love.</li>
    <li>... flying cars and other vehicles are commonplace,
    	and there is no longer any need for roads,
    	petrol, service stations, train tracks, oil
    	tankers or bus stations - these will all have
    	been replaced by parks, forests, pristine
    	oceans and wildlife corridors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>AscensionTek intends to help facilitate the transition
	towards this vision through the following activities:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Property development</strong>.&nbsp; One
		of the most important things we need to do
		on Earth at this time is to change how we inhabit
		the planet.&nbsp; Our
		residences must give more to the land than
		we take from it, producing energy, and good
		quality water and food using clean, sustainable
		methods.&nbsp; Especially during this &quot;century
		of healing&quot;, we need to allocate
		large areas of land to rehabilitation and
		wildlife conservation.<br>
		<br>
	</li>
    <li><strong>Technology development</strong>.&nbsp; Through
    	the development of new technologies such as
    	robotics, machine intelligence, genetic engineering,
    	sustainable resource production, gravity
    	control, levitational propulsion systems and
    	zero-point energy, we hope to introduce a range
    	of exciting new products to the world over
    	the course of the century that will change
    	the way we live and what it means to be human.&nbsp; We
    	believe that technology is a major key to planet-wide
    	freedom, abundance and peace, and to the successful
    	colonisation of space. <br>
    	<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Promotion of the Vision</strong>.&nbsp; We
    	intend to promote the vision of an advanced
    	human society, inhabiting multiple planets,
    	living free and at peace.&nbsp; This
    	will be done through highly entertaining science-fiction
    	comedy television programs, websites, books
    	and movies.&nbsp; By drawing attention to these
    	ideas, they will come into being. <br>
    	<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Education</strong>.&nbsp; We believe
    	everyone in the world should know the basics
    	of life - how to create a positive future for
    	themselves through visualisation and faith,
    	how to have a happy relationship with God,
    	and the benefits of learning and sharing, productive
    	and results-oriented creativity, and of showing
    	kindness and love to all living things.<br>
    	<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Health</strong>.&nbsp; We believe everyone
    	should have access to the elements of good
    	health, and that this should not come at a
    	price.&nbsp; We
    	will seek to develop technological automated
    	systems to provide an abundance of pure water,
    	 fresh whole organic foods, and energy to everyone
    	in the world, and to promote this vision.<br>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At AscensionTek we understand the timeless metaphysical
	concept that &quot;energy flows where attention goes&quot;,
	also known in modern times as the Law of Attraction.&nbsp; That
	is why we focus on positives only, and express
	a vision of a positive human future.&nbsp; We are
	not interested in the current &quot;powers-that-be&quot;,
	since they have no power, neither are we interested
	in conspiracies or supressed technology.&nbsp; There
	is nothing that can prevent us from developing
	new technology - all that is required is to visualise
	the result, infuse it with faith, and continually
	put thought and energy into it.&nbsp; In fact, we
	derive great encouragement from the knowledge that
	some of the technologies we would see developed,
	such as zero-point energy devices and levitational
	vehicles, already exist, since this makes it easier
	to believe that we ourselves can then develop or
	obtain them.</p>
