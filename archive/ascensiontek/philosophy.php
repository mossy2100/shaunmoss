<h1>AscensionTek Philosophy</h1>

<p>The philosophy underlying AscensionTek is one of
	idealism and service.&nbsp; I believe that
	the smartest way to live is through
	service to the greater good, and that this philosophy
	is used by advanced races throughout
	the cosmos.&nbsp; In our case, the &quot;greater good&quot;
	is Earth and the Solar System.</p>
<p>The company is specifically designed to achieve
	a positive benefit for Earth and everyone
	and everything that lives on it.&nbsp; This will be
	achieved through:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Spreading the understanding </strong>that we can create
		a great abundance of resources, energy, health,
		happiness and love for all, by using the correct
		thoughts, words and actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Developing technology </strong>to enable
    	us to access more energy and resources, for
    	spiritual and mental development, and to live
    	in more places throughout the Solar System.</li>
    <li><strong>Creating projects </strong>that inspire the imagination
    	and produce tangible benefits for everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Producing and sharing
    		ideas </strong>for making the
    	Solar System a more wonderful place to live.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspiring people </strong>by spreading
    	the vision of an exciting, positive human future.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Core Company Philosophy</h2>
<p>AscensionTek is therefore committed to affecting
	life on Earth in as positive a way as possible,
	while simultaneously having a really great time.&nbsp; I
	do fully intend to for the business to become extremely
	wealthy and successful, simply because this is
	how we can effect the greatest good.&nbsp; Money is
	simply an energy, one that represents creative power
	and self-worth, and creative power and self-worth
	are exactly what we will need to turn this planet
	into an Eden and colonise Heaven (space) in a positive
	way.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts about money, I urge you to
	become rich as soon as possible.&nbsp; Yes, you can.&nbsp;	You
	can start by reading <a href="http://www.scienceofgettingrich.net/" target="_blank">&quot;The
Science of Getting Rich&quot;</a> by Wallace Wattles,
which explains how the universe is fundamentally compsed
of consciousness energy which can be directly affected
by our own thoughts.&nbsp; This
	means if you imagine something and believe in it,
	and put energy into it, it <strong>will </strong>manifest.&nbsp; Then
	I would recommend that you watch or read <a href="http://www.thesecret.tv/" target="_blank">&quot;The
	Secret&quot;</a>,
	and then, if you are really serious about getting
	rich, join the <a href="http://www.wealthbeyondreason.com/" target="_blank">Wealth
	Beyond Reason</a> program (I am not affilitaed with
	these dudes - I just learn from them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The company will systemise and share its ecovillage
	and habitat development solutions, so that similar
	projects can be developed faster and more easily by
	ourselves as well as others.&nbsp; The global housing
	market and demand for sustainable mass accommodation
	will be extremely large over the next few decades
	due to the effects of climate change, therefore I
	intend to freely publish everything we learn.&nbsp; There
	is no danger of losing business to competition by
	doing this, as demand will far exceed supply, and
	it is much more important that the thousands of new
	communities be constructed sustainably.&nbsp; In fact,
	the company's reputation will be enhanced by showing
	selflessness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Law of Attraction </h2>
<p>Can the Law of Attraction be used to build
	a multi-billion dollar space development company?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
