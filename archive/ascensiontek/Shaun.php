<h1>Shaun Moss </h1>

<p>I'm an Australian space enthusiast with a Bachelor
	of Science in Maths and Computer Science, plus
	supplementary studies in information systems engineering,
	robotics, fitness, and investment strategies.&nbsp; Since
	my childhood I've been interested in the planets
	of our Solar System, and in about 1999 I
	realised that humans would establish permanent
	settlements on Mars during my lifetime.&nbsp; I
decided that being a part of that would be a cool thing
	to do with my life.</p>
<p>My current residence is in Brisbane, Queensland,
	Australia, where I've lived on-and-off since
	1988.&nbsp; I
	was born in Melbourne, grew up on the Sunshine
	Coast, have lived and worked in the Netherlands,
	Ireland and the UK, and have travelled to North
	America three times to attend space conferences.</p>
<p>My work experience is highly varied,
	although it has been predominantly software development
	for PCs and the web.&nbsp; At
	present I work full-time in Brisbane as a web application
	developer, and occasional graphic designer.&nbsp; I
	have also worked as a computer technician, lecturer
	in computing topics, maths and science tutor, steel
	building salesperson, computer salesperson, door-to-door
	salesperson, sales manager, video editor,
	drummer in a hip-hop band, personal trainer, draftsperson,
	and project officer and industrial designer in
	the metalliferous mining sector.&nbsp; I
	have operated businesses in home tutoring,
	door-to-door sales, and web development.</p>
<p>I have developed my own set of rational spiritual
	beliefs based on a mixture of Christianity, New
	Age culture, and computer science.&nbsp; I
	routinely pray, as well as practice the Law of
	Attraction, realising that these are largely the
	same thing.&nbsp; I
	attend church for the social and spiritual elements,
	while trying not to get into arguments about dinosaurs,
	evolution, UFOs and quantum physics.&nbsp; I also
	participate in space enthusiast groups such as
	the Mars Society, the Space Frontier Foundation,
	and the National Space Society.</p>
<p>I drive a rusty red-and-white 1973 Volkswagen kombi
	van, and  am therefore single.</p>
