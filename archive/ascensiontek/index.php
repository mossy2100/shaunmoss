<h1>Welcome to AscensionTek</h1>

<div class="whitebox">
<p><b>Update 2012-11-05</b>: This website is now slightly out-of-date, so apologies for dead links etc.</p>
<p>I am currently focused on building <a href="http://moonmars.com">moonmars.com</a>, a new online social network for
everyone interested in space and especially space settlement: enthusiasts, businesspeople, professionals and students.
This project is being developed by my new company, Astro Multimedia.</p>
<p>However, if you're interested in my future plans, this website has some great information which is still valid.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, and welcome to the website for AscensionTek,
	a  new company based in Brisbane, Queensland,
	Australia.</p>
<p>AscensionTek is primarily a forward-thinking &quot;new
	age&quot; property development company.&nbsp; Our
	main emphasis is on high-tech sustainable development
	at all scales, including design and construction
	of environmentally-friendly steel frame homes,
	ecovillages and planned cities.&nbsp; The
	company is intended to have a lifespan of at least
	100 years, and to become extremely successful and
	well-known during that period.</p>
<p>We are interested in property development, technology
	development, and human development.&nbsp; Our long-term
	ambition is to become involved in space colonisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this website you can find information about our
	plans for the company, the types of products and
	services we plan to provide, and various
articles about space and the environment.&nbsp; The
main function of the website at this time is presentation
	of the <a href="bizplan/index.php">business
	plan</a>.&nbsp; Once
	the company is funded and has officially opened
	its doors, the site will
	be redeveloped to be more customer-oriented.</p>
<p>Our first business is called <a href="gsh/index.php">Green Steel Homes</a>, which
	provides a new style of advanced sustainable housing.&nbsp; We
	have also initiated our first  project, a small
	ecovillage with the working title of <a href="<?= $SilvergreenUrl ?>">Silvergreen</a>.
&nbsp;	This will be an intentional community of about
50 people in the Samford Valley region west of Brisbane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AscensionTek is supportive of an Australian and
	Earth space industry, global collaboration on space
	development and Earth management, and generally making
this Solar System a nice place to live. </p>
