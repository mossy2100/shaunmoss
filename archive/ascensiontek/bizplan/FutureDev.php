<h1>Phase 2: Future Developments</h1>

<p>With a significant capital base and reliable income
	streams established through the property development
	business, the company will be in a position to
	shift into phase 2, in which we explore commercial
	opportunities with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Highly profitable.</li>
    <li>Interesting and fun. </li>
    <li>Creates a positive benefit for Earth and society.</li>
    <li>Provide experience and/or produce technologies
    	that will move the company towards its space
    	colonisation goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two most important industries that fit these
	categories are <strong>metals </strong> and <strong>robotics</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Metals</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons for getting involved
	in metals: </p>
<ol>
	<li>After tourism, recreation and property development,
		metals production will be one of the
		primary economic drivers on the Moon and Mars.
		 Just as with
		ecovillages, being involved with metalliferous
		mining projects on Earth will be good practice
		for space.</li>
	<li>Producing our own steel will benefit our steel
		building business. </li>
	<li>Money.&nbsp; Metals prices continue to climb,
		and demand
		for metals is likely to increase massively
		during the 21st century for several reasons:
        		<ul>
        			<li>growing population</li>
        			<li>global industrialisation</li>
        			<li>building new infrastructure in the
        				wake of climate change</li>
        			<li>preference for metals in construction
        				as living trees become more
        				highly valued</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>For property and infrastructure development on the
	Moon and Mars, local production of metals and other
	materials is essential.&nbsp; Furthermore, as
	demand for metals on Earth climbs, it may become
	economically viable to import metals from the
	Moon, Mars and the asteroids once the cost of transport
	becomes low enough.&nbsp; Concentrated metals are
	available in great abundance in space, and can
be obtained without biological impact.</p>
<p>Many space colonies will be analogous
	to remote mining towns, where entire communities
	crystallise around concentrated metal deposits,
	so it will be highly valuable for
the company to have experience with metalliferous
mining, metals production, and mining communities.</p>
<h3>Iron and Steel</h3>
<p>Steel is the most important metal on Earth,
	as is likely to be the case on Luna and Mars
	as well.&nbsp; Iron, the main constituent of steel,
	is the most abundant metal in the universe, which
	makes steel very cheap.&nbsp; Steel is a great
	material for making all kinds of things from paperclips
	to transcontinental railways.</p>
<p>Producing our own steel will deliver advantages
	to the steel building component of the business,
	helping to streamline operations, ensuring reliable
	supply, and lowering costs.</p>
<p>One of the most important goals for the company
	is to develop a new method of steel production
	that does not require fossil fuels for either iron
	ore reduction or power generation.&nbsp; This
	idea developed from research into methods for manufacturing
	steel on Mars (see the <a href="../downloads/index.php">Downloads</a> page
	for my &quot;Steelmaking on Mars&quot; paper).</p>
<h3>Titanium</h3>
<p>Titanium is becoming an increasingly important and
	popular metal.&nbsp; Its excellent material
	properties make it ideal for aerospace applications,
	 which is interesting considering its abundant
	availability on the Moon.&nbsp; Titanium's
	value will be emphasised on the Moon because of
	the extremes of temperature - titanium is
	resistant to the effects of thermal
	cycling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because titanium
	minerals absorb helium-3 particularly well, titanium
	and helium-3 are usually found in concentration
	together on the Moon.&nbsp; Helium-3
	has been identified as a highly valuable
	substance because fusion reactors
	fuelled by helium-3 do not produce any nuclear
	radiation - only water.&nbsp; Excellent
	leverage could be obtained by producing both titanium
	and helium-3 from the same lunar mines.&nbsp; (Note
	that AscensionTek does not encourage development
	of nuclear fusion as we see zero-point energy as
	having much more potential for safe, abundant energy
	production.&nbsp; However, our policy does not mean
	that a significant market for helium-3 will not
	exist!)</p>
<p>New methods
			of refining titanium such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFC_Cambridge" target="_blank">FFC
			Cambridge Process</a> mean that titanium
			is becoming cheaper, and will
			therefore soon find new applications and
			new markets.
		&nbsp;	By becoming involved in this industry we
		can make significant profits both on and off
		Earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Robotics</h2>
<p>With the development of a robust software and IT
	department, and experience with building smart
	(computerised) houses, the company
	will be well-positioned to develop its own artificial
intelligence and robotics department.</p>
<p>Especially once we are operating our own metalliferous
	mines, the company will directly benefit from
	developing robots and automation systems for the
	mining industry.&nbsp; We
	may also look at developing robots for construction
	and land-rehabilitation (e.g. automated greenhouses
	and tree-planting robots).&nbsp; Robotics will also
	play a critical role in space colonisation, being
	useful in mining, construction, exploration and
	transport, and it will be possible to adapt many
	of the robots developed for applications on Earth,
	for use on the Moon and Mars. </p>
<p>Robotics and AI promise to be fundamentally Earth-changing
	technologies during this century, freeing us from
	most kinds of manual labour and systemisable decision-making.</p>
<p>This
		will be an extremely profitable component of
	the business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Physics Research</h2>
<p>It's hard to say if or when this aspect of the company
	will begin.</p>
<p>Let's put it this way.&nbsp; The general philosophy
	of the company is this:&nbsp; There
	are some things we need to achieve our goals.&nbsp; If
	no-one else is doing them, then we will.</p>
<h3>Levitational Propulsion Systems </h3>
<p>One of the things we need to achieve our goals is
	known as CATS, or &quot;cheap access to space&quot;.&nbsp; It
	seems the best way to achieve this is by &quot;anti-gravity&quot;,
	although I prefer the term	&quot;levitational
propulsion&quot; or simply &quot;levity&quot;.</p>
<p>Reactionless propulsion is real.&nbsp; There
	is no longer any doubt about this - just visit <a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/lifters/main.htm" target="_blank">JLN
	Labs</a> and
	find out how you can easily make your own model
	out of balsa wood, copper wire and aluminium foil
	that defies Newton's Second &quot;Law&quot;.&nbsp; Then
	you might like to visit <a href="http://www.americanantigravity.com/" target="_blank">American
	Antigravity</a> or
	<a href="http://www.gctspace.com/main.html" target="_blank">Gravity
	Control Technologies</a>.&nbsp; Both NASA
	and ESA are researching levitational propulsion.</p>
<p>The value of a space transportation system that
	relies on a reactionless and possible even fuelless
	propulsion system is inestimable - especially to a
	space property development business!&nbsp; But what
	about the value to Earth of very fast and cheap transport
	between any locations around the world?&nbsp; If nothing
	else, consider global food distribution.
&nbsp;	Fresh fruit and veggies for everyone!&nbsp; No-one
would ever be hungry again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
	development in this field is hampered
	by general skepticism from the mainstream scientific
	community, a lack of willingness to accept that
	the universe is more complex than we thought,
	and a certain stigma from its connection with
	the UFO community and conspiracy theories.&nbsp; None
	of this really matters - if
	these technologies have real potential, and the
	evidence suggests that they do, then, in light
	of the potential benefits, we should be investing
	as much as possible in their rapid development.</p>
<p>Hopefully this technology will begin to be taken
	seriously and developed by others in the near term,
	so we can use them.&nbsp; Otherwise we may invest
	in them ourselves when funds are available.</p>
<h3>Zero-Point Energy </h3>
<p>This technology is very much in the same category
	as levitational propulsion, and indeed, many of
	the people researching one are also researching
	the other.&nbsp; The existence of ZPE is predicted
	by quantum physics and refers to very high levels
	of energy available everywhere in the universe,
	even in a vacuum, which is why it is also sometimes
	known as vacuum energy.</p>
<p>The value of ZPE technology is even greater than
	levitational propulsion.&nbsp; Not only will we not
	need fossil fuels or nuclear fission any more,
	but if
	ZPE power plants can be made cost-effective, then
	they will even compete with solar and wind, which
	are dependent on weather.&nbsp; But
	ZPE is always there - everywhere!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Environment Control Systems</h2>
<p>An ECS (Environment Control System) controls parameters
	like the temperature, humidity and constituents (most
	importantly O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations)
	of air within a volume such as a habitat or greenhouse.&nbsp; Actually,
	any air-conditioner, heater, humidifier, dehumidifier
	or air-scrubber is an ECS of some description.</p>
<p> ECS's are needed for any communities in extreme
	environments, whether in the desert, in polar regions,
	or in space.&nbsp; We will develop these types of
	systems for use in advanced ecovillages before using
	them in analogue and real space settlements.&nbsp; For
	example, when building ecovillages in the Queensland
	outback, we may like to build environment-controlled
	greenhouses so the residents can grow their own food
	locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Analogue Research </h2>
<p>This is unlikely to be a directly profitable activity.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
	major benefits can be gained by investing
	in analogue research:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Knowledge and experience.</strong>&nbsp; Plenty
		of valuable experience can be (and is being)
		gained from analogue space settlements on Earth,
		which provide insight into many of the engineering
		and human factors challenges we will face in
		space.&nbsp; We
		will certainly avoid many costly mistakes
		by operating analogue stations on Earth before
		building real ones.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising.</strong>&nbsp; Analogue
    	space settlements gain attention in the media
    	and especially in the space community.&nbsp; Sponsoring
    	these projects would be good for our reputation
    	and for getting the company known.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this stage it is envisaged that AscensionTek
	will mainly support <a href="http://www.marssociety.org.au/MarsOZ.php" target="_blank">Mars-Oz</a> (the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Analogue_Research_Station" target="_blank">Mars
	Analogue Research Station</a> being built by <a href="http://www.marssociety.org.au/" target="_blank">Mars
	Society Australia</a>),
	and possibly also analogue studies being proposed
	by the <a href="http://www.marshome.org/" target="_blank">Mars
	Foundation</a>.&nbsp; I would also like to build a
	Moon/Mars analogue space settlement in Antarctica,
	eventually working our way up to the <a href="../ice/index.php">Institute
	for Colonisation and Exploration</a>. </p>
