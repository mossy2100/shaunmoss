<b>Update 26-Dec-2007</b> //
This part of the website is currently out-of-date by
about 6 months, and the business plan has changed to include the SolSys
virtual environment. The current strategy is to develop SolSys to a
playable demo stage, then seek funding again.
</div>

<br />


<p>This is the main part of the website (at this stage).&nbsp; I have
split the business plan into sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="Intro.php">AscensionTek</a></b> is the main
&quot;parent&quot; company.&nbsp; This company has goals of developing
new systems and technologies for living on Earth, space property
development (especially the Moon and Mars), and generally being a
beneficial service to humanity over the course of the 21st century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="pe/index.php"><strong>Pacific Ecovillages</strong></a> is
the company that will build ecovillages.&nbsp; This is the first major
project, and the most developed part of the business plan so far.&nbsp;
For an investor, this is the most important section to read at this
time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="../gsh/index.php">Green Steel Homes</a></b> will design
and build a new style of fully sustainable, smart, futuristic
steel-frame homes.&nbsp; The designs are still under development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../viriditas/index.php"><strong>Viriditas</strong></a> will
design and build native plant and permaculture gardens, and provide land
rehabilitation services and training in garden maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
