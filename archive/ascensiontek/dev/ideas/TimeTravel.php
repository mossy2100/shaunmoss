Time Travel

Eventually we want to develop time travel.  This is mainly a question of server space and VR technology, which is increasingly exponentially, so we know we will get there eventually.

This requires storing a snapshot of the VE at every moment of the game.  Or, being able to rollback the database to any point in time, by unwinding the changes.

Then copying the database from that moment onto another server, and starting a new simulation from that point on that server.  This will cause an exponential increase in the number of SolSys's running at any one time.

When a Player time travels back in time, they create a fork.  The database from that moment is copied, and a new simulation instance is started with that Player in it (however - there may not be PCs in it - only NPCs! how could that work...?  The same Players would be present in the copied simulation - so it wouldn't be the same as going back in time.)
