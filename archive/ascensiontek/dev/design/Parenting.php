<h1>Reproduction and Parenting</h1>

<pre>
Players can reproduce within SolSys, in the sense that they can produce a new avatar that includes physical traits from the parent(s).  Traditional two-parent reproduction is still common, yet considered old-fashioned.  Many residents of SolSys reproduce by themselves (cloning) or using physical traits from 3 or more parents, sometimes whole communities.

There is no pregnancy or gestation period.  Humans, Androids and ETs are produced fully-grown at appropriate scientific facilities, generally within 2-5 days.

If one or more Players decide they want to make a baby, there are several options.

	1.  Single-Human reproduction, i.e. Human cloning.  The new Human's avatar is exactly the same as the parent.  It is necessary to first find another Player willing to accept the cloned avatar; this can be done by advertising on the SolSys  bulletin board (SSBB).  The parent pays a Human Growth Clinic a certain amount of gold in order to grow their child - there is no pregnancy or gestation period, and the child appears in the environment fully-grown.

	2.  Multi-Human reproduction (traditional).  If two or more Humans decide to make a baby, they must first find another Player who is willing to be the child.  The new Player designs their avatar by selecting attributes from the parents.  Again, there is no pregnancy or gestation period; the children are produced full-grown.
	
	3.  Android cloning.  This is reasonably simple.  The Android parent only needs to find a robotics factory willing ro provide this service (frequently the factory where they themselves were manufactured), and provide the schematics of their own bodies to the engineers.

	3.  Human-Android reproduction, i.e. Cyborgs.  It is possible to create a cyborg by combining traits from a Human and an Android.  This unusual form of union began during the 21st century, when Humans began wanting to have children with their sexbots.  From about 2080, several robotics companies began providing this service by manufacturing what were known as "kidbots".  As cybernetic technology developed, cyborg children became available that included robotic technology as well as living Human tissue containing DNA from the Human parent.  To produce a cyborg child, the parents must find an appropriate company willing to provide this service.

	4.  Human-ET.  This is sometimes successful, for example, Human-Zeta and Human-Arcturian hybrids are not uncommon.  There have also been reports of Human-Repterrian hybrids, although these seem to be rare.  Humans do not yet have the genetic technology to produce these hybrids; only advanced ET-operated facilities can do this.
	
	5.  Android-Android reproduction.  Most robotics companies can produce a new Android that incorporates physical characteristics from two or more Android parents.
