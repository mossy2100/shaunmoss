<h5>SolSys Game Design</h5>

<h1>Economics</h1>

<pre>
This page discusses a range of economic issues related to SolSys, including economics of the business, as well as the in-game economy.

<h2>The In-game Economy</h2>

<pre>
The common currency of the Solar System is gold (or, commonly, e-gold).  Players can obtain gold by earning it, through trading, or by purchasing e-gold using real life money.

<b>Purchasing gold</b>

This is basically how we get paid for the game.  Players can come into the game with no gold, and still explore and meet people.  However, to acquire items such as spacesuits, levitation harnesses, special abilities, spacecraft, land, structures, etc., they need money.  Although a Player can earn money doing things for other Players (e.g. piloting)

The exchange rate is 1:10,000.  So, if a Player buys 1 gram of gold ("1gAu" in SolSys notation), they have 10,000gAu (or "10kgAu") in SolSys.  To keep things simple, we assume that a gram of gold has about the same value then as now.  So, if the player spends $30 on the game by purchasing 1 gram of gold, his spending power within the game environment is roughly equivalent to A$300,000 in today's dollars (enough for a new spacecar and an apartment).  Note - the exchange rate between real and virtual gold will probably vary over the life of the game.

<b>Earning gold</b>

Players can earn gold by doing things for other Players.  There is a very simple interface for transferring gold between Players.

Examples:
- Piloting.  A Player can fly another Player's ship between destinations; often a cargo ship.
- SpaceForce.  The UP funds an organisation called SpaceForce that maintains order and discipline in SolSys.  They have replaced all other police and military forces within SolSys, and are largely made up of Humans and Androids, although ETs often act as consultants to SpaceForce.  The primary roles of SpaceForce are to maintain internal law and order within SolSys, and to defend SolSys against its enemies such as the Repterrians.  SpaceForce pilots explore SolSys, contribute to the design of SolSys security systems, and frequently go on missions.
