<h1>Mind Powers</h1>

Mind powers are a particular category of <a href='Proficiencies.php'>Proficiency</a>.

<h2>Telepathy</h2>

Telepathy is a <b>standard</b> feature in the future - everyone has it.  You can still hear environmental noises, but you can also read (in the chat window) all people's thoughts that:

a) Are in your vicinity (within 25m - this distance is customizable)

b) Are on your "Listen List".  So, you can add all your friends and family to your Listen List, and their thoughts will apear as messages in your chat window.

Your can send thoughts (chat messages) to all the people in your vicinity, and everyone who has you on their "Listen List".  You can also have private telepathic conversations by creating chat channels.

You can also Block people from listening to your thoughts.

In this way you can monitor whose thoughts you hear, and who hears yours.


<h2>Telekinesis</h2>

This is a proficiency that ETs have automatically.  Humans can learn it at an appropriate Training Centre.


<h2>Teleportation</h2>

This is a very advanced proficiency, which only Arcturians have by default.  Humans can learn it, but it takes a lot of time and can be expensive.  Androids cannot teleport themselves, however, they can be teleported.
