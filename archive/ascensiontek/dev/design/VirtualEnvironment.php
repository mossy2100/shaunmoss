<h1>The Virtual Environment</h1>

<p>
SolSys takes place in a VE (Virtual Environment), modelled on the Solar System of 150 years into the future.  It is a persistent model, meaning that a Player can leave the environment, then enter it later and find things much as they left them.
</p>

<p>
The SolSys Client (the program that Players download so they can access the environment) is called <b>Omega</b>.<br>
The SolSys server network and software is known as <b>SolNet</b>.
