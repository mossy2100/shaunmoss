<h1>Genders</h1>

<pre>
There are three possible genders a character can choose from:

	<b>Male</b>
	<b>Female</b>
	<b>Androgynous</b>

Humans are usually male or female, but due to developments in genetic engineering, androgynous Humans are not unusual.  In fact, whole societies of androgynous Humans exist that reproduce purely using genetic engineering.

Androids are usually androgynous, however, many have been designed specifically to resemble a Human male or female (especially Sexbots).  Hence some Androids prefer to specify their gender as male or female.

ETs can be either any of the 3 genders, depending on species.  Zetas, for example, are always androgynous, whereas Sirians can be male or female.
