Players have the option (and are encouraged) to write their own realistic back story about their character, e.g. they can make up whatever they want about their parents, birthplace, or how they got to their start location.  Back stories can be posted on the community site.  Generally, a good story will be one that fits with the SolSys history, and with the character's type, location and personality.
