<h1>Proficiencies</h1>

<p>Different types and subtypes have "<b>general proficiencies</b>" in different areas, so the character will have these proficiences from the beginning.  General as well as "<b>special proficiencies</b>" can also be gained during the game by contributing creatively to the development of SolSys.</p>

<h2>General Proficiencies</h2>

<ol>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>The Arts</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Spirituality</li>
<li>Science</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Computers</li>
<li>Medicine</li>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Hydrology</li>
<li>Ecology</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Mining</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Construction</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Genetics</li>

</ol>


<p>The advantage of having proficiencies is that certain transactions, processes and situations more likely to work out in your favour.  e.g. if you have proficiencies in business and mining, then you would do well to start a mine - it will have more success than most.  If your proficiences are robotics and construction, then for you a robotic construction company might have a better chance of success than other business ideas.</p>

<p>You can show whichever ones you want on your public info page, thereby advertising your skills or personality.  (you can also hide whichever ones you don't want to show).</p>

<br>

<h2>Special Proficiences</h2>

<p>Special proficiences are earned by playing, being creative, or training.  They can bestow special abilities, or give the Player an edge in various activities.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you like to design spacecraft using your favourite 3D modelling package.  These can be introduced to the game, and in this way you can earn a special proficiency of "spacecraft design".</p>

<p>Or, if you operated a titanium mine and refinery on the Moon, after a while you could gain a "light metals production" special proficiency, which would increase your probability of success with a similar project, such as aluminium production.</p>

<p>A Player can also visit a <b>Training Centre</b>, and pay a small amount of gold to learn a new proficiency, e.g. Chemistry, or Healing.  This may include acquirement of knowledge plus specific skills.</p>


<p>Other special proficiences could include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Building design</li>
<li>Base design</li>
<li>Property development</li>
<li>Textures</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Art</li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Multimedia</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Graphic design</li>
<li>Aerospace vehicles</li>
<li>Ground vehicles</li>
<li>Iron and steel</li>
<li>Base metals</li>
<li>Light metals</li>
<li>Platinum-group metals</li>
<li>Electronics</li>
<li>Toys</li>
<li>Jewellery</li>
<li>Fashion</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Grains</li>
<li>Water purification</li>
<li>Healing</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Telepathy</li>
<li>Telekinesis</li>
<li>Teleportation</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>


@todo need to list special proficiences that correlate with real world skills that people can contribute to the game.
