<h1>Combat</h1>

<p class='important'>
One of the most challenging questions about the SolSys design has been whether to include combat in the game or not.  At present, it <b>is</b> included.
</p>

<h2>Should Combat be included in SolSys?</h2>

<p>

</p>




<p>
Combat within SolSys is generally rare.  Humans have become much more sensitive and less violent, due to development of the Internet, merging of global culture, and the use of a common language ("Common English").
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, every major Settlement in SolSys has the technology to detect aggressive actions.  All acts of aggression in a village, city or base are therefore automatically reported to the local authories (SpaceForce), which basically gives them permission to hunt the Player down. 
</p>

<p>Combat is only permitted in certain regions of SolSys.  Also, any sort of aggression is automatically reported 

It remains to be seen what sort of weapons there are in SolSys.
