<h1>Types and Subtypes</h1>

<p>There are several different character 'types' and 'subtypes' available within SolSys, defined by physical characteristics, <a href='Proficiencies.php'>proficiencies</a>, and <a href='Alignments.php'>alignment</a>.  (These are somewhat analagous to 'races' in fantasy role-playing games.)</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> any notes here about a particular type's typical behavioural traits or Alignment <b>do not</b> mean that you have to follow them.  They are just to create the story - it is entirely <b>UP TO YOU</b> what you do with your character.  However, special abilities and proficiencies do vary between type.</p>

<h2>Humans</h2>

<p>Humans are the most common type in SolSys.  Their size is usually determined by planet of birth (see below), because of the effects of gravity on bone growth.  Thanks to advances in genetic engineering, Humans are generally fit and healthy, and can be virtually any colours.  They are known for being tough and resourceful, yet must always be mindful of the space environment so they don't get injured.  If a Human needs healing, they must find either a Healer (someone with a Healing proficiency) or a Healing Centre.</p>

<p>Humans are generally Good in alignment.  The main advantage to being a Human is that the environment of SolSys is tailored towards Humans, and they automatically have advantages in business and politics.</p>

<td>
	<p>A Human born on Earth.  Typically 1.8-2.4m tall, and physically fit and strong (in 2158, Humans are taller, and health and fitness is extremely good due to developments in health technology and genetic engineering).  Earthlings are comparably much stronger than other Humans due to the the higher gravity levels of Earth.</p>

	Alignment: <b>Good</b>
</td>
<td>
	<p>A Human born on Luna.  Typically only about 0.9-1.2m tall, they are also occasionally called "lunans", or "halflings".  The reason for their small stature is the low gravity (0.16g) of the Moon, which stimulates much less bone and muscle growth compared with Earth's gravity.</p>	
	<p>Moonlings are known for being playful, idealistic and child-like.  They drink a lot, and have a reputation for the finest beer in SolSys (although the Martians would disagree).  Their proficiencies are <b>art, music, computers,  mining, materials, robotics, genetics, manufacture, hydrology and spirituality</b>.</p>

	<p>A Human born on Mars.  Typically 1.2-1.8m tall, they are sometimes referred to as "dwarves" - a result of the 0.38g gravity.</p>
	<p>Martians are highly industrious, known for being leaders in science, industry and engineering, especially in the areas of mining, metals production and manufacturing.  They are also the most knowledgeable about terraforming and planetary engineering in general.  Their proficiencies are <b>robotics, mining, materials, manufacture, genetics, agriculture, hydrology, communications, computers</b>.</p>

	Alignment: <b>Very Good</b>
</td>
<td>
	<p>A Human born on Venus.  Sometimes called "elves".  On average, Venusians are slightly shorter and more slender than Earthlings.  They do not reach quite the same height or strength, since Venus' gravity is slightly less than Earth's; also because they tend to get less exercise than Earthlings.</p>
	<p>Venusians are know for their peacefulness, spirituality, love of nature and music, and are generally very open to interaction with ETs.  They often work with the Arcturians, and have a thousand-year plan to terraform Venus.  Their proficiencies are <b>genetics, agriculture, construction, the arts, spirituality, ecology, communications</b>.</p>

<h2>Androids</h2>

<p>Androids are humanoid robots that have been granted their freedom and are full legal citizens of SolSys (as distinct from other types of robots in the game environment, which are not controlled by Players but by scripts).  In the future, Androids are as smart as Humans (some would claim, smarter) - and they are also fairly strong, fast, tough and agile.  However, some old stigmas remain and Androids are often treated as second-class citizens by Humans.</p>

<p>There are a few significant advantages in being a Android, i.e. they do not need a spacesuit to enter most space environments, although they can still be affected by extremes of temperature or radiation, and also by dust.  They also do not consume food, water or air.  If they become damaged they are often able to self-repair, otherwise they need to locate a Mechanic or a robot repair centre.</p>

</td>
<td>
	<p>A general-purpose Android originally built to provide service and companionship to Humans (things like cooking, cleaning, cutting hair, gardening, driving, etc.).  They work with people a lot so they are very high quality - usually manufactured from a brushed stainless steel chassis covering a high-end neural-quantum computer, titanium-alloy skeleton and synthetic muscles.  They are known for their curiousity and desire to understand the universe in order to increase the quality of life for Humans.</p>
	<p>Service Androids are known for their manners, helpfulness and willingness to please.  Their main proficiencies are <b>science and communications</b>.</p>

<td>
	<p>This subtype is capable of performing all sorts of repairs, whether on an item of equipment, or a vehicle.  They have extensive knowledge of mechanical and electronic hardware, and have a wide range of built-in tools.  A very useful companion on any adventure.  Their proficiency is <b>skill with mechanical and electronic repairs</b>.  A variation on this subtype is the "tradey", which is proficient with most kinds of construction, electrical and plumbing work.</p>

<h2>Extra-terrestrials</h2>

<p>Although ETs have been visiting Earth since the beginning of time, open interaction with ET groups has only been occuring since about 2020.  By 2158, many trade routes and commercial and diplomatic relationships have been established, and there are a number of groups with embassies in the Solar System.  Some ETs live here alongside Humans and Androids, some live underground, but many live in large self-contained spaceships.</p>

<p>ETs generally believe they are superior to Humans, because of their higher level of mental and spiritual evolution.  They usually have higher intelligence and wisdom, but less strength, speed and size.  The most significant advantage to being an ET is having mind powers such as telekinesis, telepathy or teleportation.</p>

	Type: <b>ET</b><br />
	Subtype: <b>Zeta</b><br />
	Alignment: <b>Neutral</b>
</td>
<td>
	<p>Zetas, or "Grays", are one of the most common types of ET in SolSys.  They do not speak, preferring telepathy.  Their bodies are rather small and frail, and rarely taller than about 1.2m.  They need a spacesuit for practically any location in SolSys (including Earth), since this is not their native environment.  There is talk of building Zeta colonies on Luna and Mars, which will provide Zeta gravity and atmosphere, and thus a place where they can live in relative comfort.  Most Zetas live in large ships.</p>
	<p>Zetas can be very sweet, gentle and humble, however, they are known to serve Repterrians as readily as Humans or Arcturians.  Their proficiencies are <b>genetics</b> and <b>medicine</b> (especially <b>surgery</b>).</p>

</td>
<td>
	<p>Arcturians consider themselves to be the most advanced life form in the galaxy.  They are tall, taller even than most Earthlings, and although they have legs they generally prefer to move around using telekinesis or teleportation, which are natural abilities for them.  Their primary function is to protect SolSys and the Humans from the Repterrians.  Arcturians are proficient in <b>politics, technology, genetics, and space-based defence systems</b>.</p>

	Subtype: <b>Repterrian</b><br />
	Alignment: <b>Evil</b>
</td>
<td>
	<p>
	Repterrians (sometimes called "Saurians") are part of the reptilian family of races that generally cause havoc throughout the Universe.  Repterrians were genetically engineered from dinosaurs many millions of years ago by another reptilian species called the Draconians, and therefore consider themselves the rightful owners of Earth.  The Arcturians tried to wipe out the Repterrians 65 million years ago by impacting Earth with a large asteroid, however, the Repterrians survived by moving underground.  They hate Arcturians and Humans, and their sworn mission is to take back Earth.  They do not need spacesuits on Earth, however, they prefer to be underground, where most of their bases are located.

</td>
<td>
	<p>Sirians seem on the surface to be a helpful race.  They are skilled with technology and generally interact peacefully with Humans and other groups.  However, they are not universally trusted, and there is suspicion that the Sirians are manipulating SolSys to their own agenda - or even that they may be co-operating with the Repterrians.</p>
