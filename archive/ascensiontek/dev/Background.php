<h1>Background</h1>

<pre>
The original game concept was conceived in 1999.  After reading Red Mars, I began imagining a
VR-style game where the players would role-play being the first colonists on Mars, build bases
and create a society there.   The idea was to base a game around construction, creativity and cooperation,
rather than destruction and competition.  This became "Virtual Mars", which was an active project
around 2000, although at that time it barely progressed beyond presentation of the idea.

In 2001 I became involved with an online game/micro-nation called the Republic of Mars,
in which the Players role-played creating a future martian society.  This included establishing
and designing bases, creating systems for time-keeping, economics and law, and designing a planetary
government.  The one thing that ROM lacked (imho) was a good virtual environment.

Over time I expanded the concept to include other planets, and ultimately the entire Solar System.
In a future where we are colonising Mars, we are also likely to have space vehicles that enable us
to visit other worlds in the Solar System relatively easily as well.

The vision for SolSys has evolved to be more than a game or virtual environment.  It is a mechanism
for co-creating a positive and exciting vision for the future, combining science, engineering,
technology, economics, business and community.  The result will be an enjoyable and educational
online space-sim where players can experience what it could be like in the future.
