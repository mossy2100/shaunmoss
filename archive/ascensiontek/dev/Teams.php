<li>writers</li>
<li>musicians</li>
<li>scientists</li>
<li>engineers</li>
<li>designers</li>
<li>architects</li>
<li>business-people</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This an educational project and students in particular are encouraged to participate.  However, you certainly do not have to be a student to become involved in SolSys.
