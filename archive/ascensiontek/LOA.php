<h1>Geoengineering and the Law of Attraction</h1>

<p>Since the release of &quot;The Secret&quot; book
and DVD, the LOA has received a lot of attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This
	reality is a <strong>shared dream </strong>produced from the minds
	of every participating human, and for one person's
	reality to change it requires the subconscious
	assent of all those who would be affected by the
	change.&nbsp; This
	explains a very interesting story in the Bible.&nbsp; When
	Jesus went to Galilee, the place where he grew
	up, he was not able to perform many miracles there
	because people saw him as Joseph's son and as a
	carpenter, and not as the Messiah.&nbsp; What this
	passage reveals is that <em>Jesus's power to perform
	miracles did not come only from himself.</em>&nbsp; He
	was given the power by the people who observed
	him.&nbsp; They believed it was possible because of
	who He was, and so it became possible.&nbsp; Jesus's
	ability to change reality required that subconscious
	agreement of all the other people who would be
	affected by that change, and in most cases this
	agreement was given because (a) of his extremely
	powerful mind and charisma, and (b) because they
	desperately wanted to believe that He was the Messiah,
	and deeply wanted these miracles to occur.</p>
<p>So, the Bible, quantum physics, and many historical,
	 religious, magickal and metaphysical texts reveal
	that the Law of Attraction is true.&nbsp; It all boils
	down to one key principle:</p>
<h4 align="center"><strong>REALITY IS AFFECTED BY YOUR THOUGHTS</strong></h4>
<p>Let's consider this parallel.&nbsp; Global culture
	has been declining in morality for at least 20
	years and probably more like 500.&nbsp; Certainly,
	since the 1980's I have seen planet Earth go from
	a reasonably friendly place to somewhere basically
	unsafe.&nbsp; What
	sort of emotions are floating around?&nbsp; A lot
	of fear, negativity, guilt, hatred, anger, jealousy,
	unhappiness and so on.&nbsp; The general population
	has become addicted to these emotions, of this
	I am sure, because I see what most people are reading,
	and watching on TV and at the movies.&nbsp; The result
	of this addiction causes guess what - a build-up
	of even more negativity and disharmony.&nbsp; In engineering
	terms this is called &quot;positive feedback&quot; although
	that term seems incongruous in this case.&nbsp; Just
	like the greenhouse effect - as the planet heats
	up, more water vapour and CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere,
	which means the planet heats up even more, and
	so on.</p>
<p>Now, if thoughts create reality, what effects do
	we see from all of this fear and negativity?&nbsp; Let's
	see... war, famine, drought, floods, massive storms...&nbsp; I
	won't go on because (as we know from the LOA) it
	is counterproductive to focus on the negative.&nbsp; I
	only mention it here to make a point.&nbsp; <strong>There
	is a link between the global consciousness and
	global weather.</strong>&nbsp; People aren't being
	&quot;cool&quot;.&nbsp; They are getting hotheaded!&nbsp; And
	the more hotheaded they get, the more fear they
	create, and the more hotheaded everyone gets.&nbsp; Result
	= global warming. </p>
<p>So - knowing this, the solution to all our global
	problems then becomes apparent!&nbsp; <strong>If
		you want the world to be a good, happy and
		safe place, THINK POSITIVE!&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Be
		Nice, Kind, Good and Friendly!&nbsp; Choose love
		over fear in every possible aspect of life.</strong>&nbsp;  This
		is part of spiritual development.&nbsp; The
		more evolved we each become, the more we will
		naturally choose love over fear and therefore
		be in alignment with God, creating positive
		feedback effects for ourselves, purifying and
		<em>harmonizing</em> our environment, and generally
		improving quality of life for ourselves and people
		around us. </p>
<p>Jesus said: &quot;Do unto others as you would
	have others do unto you.&quot;&nbsp; What he meant
	was, love others because you want to be loved.&nbsp; Be
	kind and helpful to others if you want others to
	be kind and helpful to you.&nbsp; Teach others so
	that you will be taught.</p>
