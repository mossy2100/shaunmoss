<h1>Introduction to Ecovillages</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The design philosophy of our ecovillages
	is as follows:</p>
<h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
<div class="whitebox">
	<p align="center">Integrating technology with the
		built and natural environments to provide a
		habitation solution that is simultaneously
		sustainable, modern, long-lasting, and conducive
		to health, happiness and spiritual development.</p>
</div>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Up until now, ecovillages have been
something of an oddity, perhaps one step removed from
	a hippy commune.&nbsp; The type of place where you
	might find what we call in Australia &quot;ferals&quot; - a
	place where things like sports cars, bacon and
	personal hygiene are frowned upon.&nbsp; But no longer!&nbsp; Ecovillages
	are undergoing a renaissance, and are gaining the
	attention of the middle-to-upper-class home-buyer.&nbsp; As
	the market shifts its preferences towards environmental
	products and services, property developers are
	reacting accordingly, and &quot;green
	developments&quot; are appearing everywhere.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, not all so-called &quot;green
	developments&quot; are ecovillages.&nbsp; Some are
	no more than your usual over-crowded suburban white-picket-fence
	housing estates, just with low-flow shower heads
	installed.&nbsp; But
	to be fair, many new developments are
	being put together by people who genuinely care
	for the environment and want to make a difference.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">What is an &quot;ecovillage&quot;,
	anyway?</h2>
<p align="left">An ecovillage is a housing development
	in which there is a high degree of consideration
	for the environment, sharing, co-operation
	and community interaction.&nbsp; Usually
	there is a sense of &quot;custodianship&quot; of the
	land, with a large percentage of the land (often
	100%) owned collectively by all the residents.
&nbsp;	Unlike many housing developments, only about
20-25% is allocated for housing lots, the remainder
being preserved in (or rehabilitated to) its natural
state and/or allocated for community use such as food
production and shared buildings.</p>
<p align="left"> Community
	buildings may include a meeting place, hall,
	farm buildings, workshops, school, conference
	centre, even shops.&nbsp; Permaculture is a common
	feature, with the community seeking to produce
	a large percentage of its food requirements.&nbsp; Ecovillages
	also typically produce most of their energy requirements,
	recycle their water and
	incorporate water-saving technologies.&nbsp; Building
	with recycled or local materials and recycling
	of waste is also fairly standard, and many ecovillages
	engage in arts and crafts or provision of consultancy
	services in order to generate income.&nbsp; Some ecovillages
	pool their income.&nbsp; Some ecovillages do not allow
	cars, and many do not allow dogs or cats.</p>
<p align="left">The
		general principle is to live lightly on the
	land, with as small an &quot;ecological footprint&quot; as
	possible.</p>
<p align="left">But ecovillages are not only about
	the environment - unless you include humans in
	your definition.&nbsp; Ecovillages also seek to address
	certain social issues caused by the way of living
	that many of us have become used to.&nbsp; In modern
	city life, the &quot;nuclear family&quot; has fractured
	even further, with many of us  living in
	virtual isolation, a situation that often leads
	to emotional distress and even depression.&nbsp; The
	residents of an ecovillage, on the other hand,
	essentially become part of an extended family.&nbsp; They
	have shared activities and responsibilities, such
	as construction projects or taking care of animals
	or gardens, which keeps people interacting with
	each other.&nbsp; They
	also have regular &quot;village meetings&quot; in
	which decisions about the community are made by
	all the residents.&nbsp; Feelings
	of helplessness and isolation are rare in this
	kind of environment, where there
	is always someone to chat with or play
	with, and everyone has a say in how their immediate
	environment is evolving.</p>
<p align="left">So, ecovillages help Earth, and they
	help us -  they are quite simply the absolute
	best way we currently know of to live on Earth
	in a way that is sustainable and conducive to positive
	human development.</p>

<h2 align="left">The traditional approach </h2>
<p align="left">Once I realised that ecovillages are
	the best mode of habitation we know of on this
	planet, I wondered why it wasn't the norm.&nbsp; I
	soon learned that setting up an ecovillage is much
	harder than it looks - in fact, about 90% of ecovillage
	projects that are begun never actually get built.&nbsp; The
	main reasons are internal conflicts over money,
	legal issues, and the collective vision for the
	project.&nbsp; Another
	important reason is that many people who approach
	ecovillage projects are idealist &quot;head in the
	clouds&quot; types, and these are rarely the same
	people who have the practical business sense to
	deal with the inevitable realities of contracts,
	real estate, construction and finance.</p>
<p align="left">Ecovillages typically follow this kind
	of path: a few like-minded friends start talking
	about an ecovillage project.&nbsp; They meet every
	week or so to discuss their plans and goals, and
	to allocate tasks.&nbsp; They learn everything they
	can about real estate, co-housing, intentional
	communities, land development, permaculture and
	so on.&nbsp; After about 1-2 years (and often longer)
	a few of the most committed members put a deposit
	down on a block of land.&nbsp; They
	begin construction, and 10 years later their
	ecovillage begins to look something like their
	original vision.</p>
