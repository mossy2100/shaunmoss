<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>When the company is established and adequate financial
	reserves are available, the company will commence
	a program of R&amp;D sponsorship.&nbsp; This may take
	the form of research conducted within our own company
	laboratories, and/or sponsorship of technology R&amp;D
	companies, university research, or other independent
	researchers.&nbsp; The main technologies that AscensionTek
	actively support development of are these:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Robotics and artificial intelligence</strong>.&nbsp; Robotics
		and smart computers are destined to be an integral
		technology in a positive human future, freeing us
		from most kinds of manual labour and systemisable
		decision-making, and being instrumental workers in
		space environments.&nbsp; Robots will be essential
		elements in space construction, transport and mining,
		which will be the first things we want to do in space.</li>
	<li><strong>Gravity control and levitational propulsion
			systems</strong>.&nbsp; The next generation of space
			vehicles will be powered using field technologies.&nbsp; They
			will be fuelless, reactionless, fully reusable,
			considerably safer than rockets, and will massively
			reduce the cost of access to space.&nbsp; Regardless
			of how much the cost of rocketry can be reduced,
			these next-generation vehicles will be essential
			for space colonisation.&nbsp; Gravity control in
			the sense of creating localised artificial gravity
			fields will be an important technology for space
			stations and interplanetary spacecraft, negating
			the need for producing artificial gravity using
			centrifugal force.&nbsp; Localised 1g artificial
			gravity fields will be of use on the surface of
			other worlds for health reasons and many others.</li>
	<li><strong>Genetic engineering</strong>.&nbsp; Development
		of this technology is essential for space colonisation.&nbsp; As
		the science and understanding of genetic programming
		and design develops, we will be able to create our
		own organisms and ecosystems, restoring the biodiversity
		of Earth, and bringing life to the Moon, Mars, and
		other worlds.&nbsp; Genetics will be needed for efficient
		food production in space, and for planetary engineering
		projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Development of the human mind</strong>.&nbsp; It
		is gradually becoming mainstream knowledge that our
		objective reality is directly shaped by our thoughts.&nbsp; It
		is therefore essential that our thoughts are fixed
		on a positive and exciting human future.&nbsp; Our
		amibtion is to encourage people all around the world
		to habitually envisage a future of peace, happiness,
		love, health, abundance, and life in space, which
		we plan to do through multimedia.&nbsp; This knowledge
		is being directly applied within AscensionTek in
		order to achieve fantastic goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resource Production</h3>
<p>AscensionTek also supports development of any technologies
	that produce or manage essential resources in an environmentally
	harmonious and sustainable way.&nbsp; These technologies
	form the core components of human habitats on Earth
	and throughout the Solar System: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Energy production</strong>.&nbsp; Energy
		requirements of the human population are likely to
		increase at least 8-fold before 2050 (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Return-Moon-Exploration-Enterprise-Settlement/dp/0387242856/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9774034-5612120?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176150811&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Return
		to the Moon</a> by Harrison Schmidt).&nbsp; At present,
		85% of our energy is produced using fossil fuels,
		which are environmentally toxic, and which we will
		run out of this century even at our current rate
		of consumption.&nbsp; Nuclear fission technology
		is too dangerous, therefore other energy production
		solutions are needed as soon as possible.&nbsp; There
		are many options, all of which should be developed
		(considering our requirements), including solar power
		on Earth and from space, hot and cold nuclear fusion,
		wave and tidal energy, wind energy, geothermal energy,
		and zero-point energy.</li>
	<li> <strong>Food production</strong>.&nbsp; With
		a growing population, the ability to produce much
		larger quantities of nutritious food using fewer
		resources is essential.&nbsp; This item encompasses
		a range of research topics.&nbsp; Automated farming
		will optimise efficiency of food production and food
		quality, and will address labour shortages. &nbsp; Underground
		agriculture provides a controlled environment that
		massively increases crop yields, and leaves surface
		areas free for natural vegetation. &nbsp; Genetic
		engineering also increases crop yields, as well as
		nutrient density.&nbsp; Advertising and education
		will shift people towards healthy food choices.</li>
	<li><strong>Water production</strong>.&nbsp; Water
		is the key component required for life as we know
		it.&nbsp; For our planet to be healthy and optimally
		functional, all organisms, especially humans, need
		access to good quality water. &nbsp;Technologies
		for localised (rather than centralised) water recycling
		and purification enable the construction of human
		habitats in more locations - including the Moon and
		Mars.</li>
	<li><strong>Air purification</strong>.&nbsp; Air is
		another element essential to the health of humans
		and other organisms, and our planet as a whole.&nbsp; Air
		quality can be dramatically improved by controlling
		the release of certain substances into Earth's atmosphere,
		and by a massive global reforestation effort (see <a href="book/Geoengineering.php">Geoengineering</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>Metals production</strong>.&nbsp; As Earth's
		population grows and becomes increasingly industrialised,
		our demand for metals is increasing dramatically.&nbsp; Steel
		in particular is an essential component of
		industrialised society, and AscensionTek is interested
		in techniques for mass-producing steel without carbon
		emissions.&nbsp; Metals
		production is also likely to be one of the
		primary economic drivers of space colonisation.</li>
