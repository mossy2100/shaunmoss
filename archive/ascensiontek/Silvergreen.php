<h1>Welcome to Silvergreen Ecovillage</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Silvergreen is a world-class ecovillage which is
	likely to be situated in the Samford Valley, a
	very beautiful region just west of Brisbane, the
	capital city of Queensland, Australia.</p>

<h2 align="left">Design Notes </h2>
<p align="left">Naturally, I have not purchased any
	land as yet because there are things that need
	to be done first, such as setting up a business
	premises as well as the necessary legal entities
	for the ecovillage.&nbsp; However,
	design work can still be begun.&nbsp; Most of the
	fundamental design parameters for our ecovillages
	are listed on the <a href="EcovillageDesign.php">ecovillage
design page</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Because Silvergreen is our very first
	ecovillage, there is much less room for experimentation,
	and we must seek to reduce the challenge as much
	as possible.&nbsp; That said, all these design notes
	are highly flexible, and will evolve as more people
	add their input. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Location</h3>
<p align="left">Originally I had planned for Silvergreen
	to be located on the Sunshine Coast.&nbsp; Rainfall
	is very good there, and there are still large blocks
	of land available.&nbsp; However, I have decided to
	locate the first ecovillage in the Samford Valley
	region, and the second one at the Sunshine Coast.</p>
<p align="left">The Samford Valley is a very beautiful
	location featuring good-natured people, lots of
	trees and wonderful, sweet-smelling fresh air.&nbsp; It
	suits mainly because of convenience to Brisbane,
	where I am located, and where the business premises
	will be located.&nbsp; The
	largest blocks of land around there are mostly
	about 16-20 hectares (40-50 acres), which should
	be large enough for a small ecovillage.</p>
<p align="left">The challenge of the Samford Valley
	is lack of rainfall - the dams around
	there are currently very low.&nbsp; Fortunately
	our ecovillage design will include all the water
	catchment and recycling technology needed to overcome
	this challenge. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Size</h3>
<p align="left">I envisage a population for Silvergreen
	of only around 40-80 people.&nbsp; Staring the
	business with a project of this scale will keep
	things simple, estimates will be more accurate,
	and it will be easier to control costs and to raise
	money.&nbsp; So, I am working on rough figures of
	about 20 homes, with an average of 3 people
	per home - a total of about 40 adults and 20
	children.</p>
<p align="left">This figure is based on a block of
	land of about 16 hectares (40 acres), which is
	the size of most of the large blocks of land in
	the area around Samford.&nbsp; This
comes to about 0.8 hectares (8000m<sup>2</sup> or 2 acres) per
	household.</p>
<p align="left">Let's
	look at a few of the other ecovillages around Oz
	to compare:</p>

</table>
<p align="left">As you can see, there is some considerable
	variation in size and population density, with
	an average area per household of about 1.5 ha.&nbsp; The
	last two ecovillages in the list represent the
	extremes.</p>
<p align="left">Silvergreen will therefore be on the
	higher density side (similar to the Ecovillage
	at Currumbin).&nbsp; This
	is hard to avoid on a relatively small block of
	land close to the city, because land is more expensive
	and less available.&nbsp; Even so, the residents will
	still own 8 times as much land as they would living
	on a typical 0.1 ha (&frac14; acre) suburban block.</p>
<p align="left">For the sake of a preliminary design,
	I am working with the following figures:</p>
<ul>
	<li>20% of land allocated for housing (3.2 ha)</li>
    <li>10% for
    		common land - that's community buildings,
    	roads, permaculture gardens and farmland (1.6
    	ha). </li>
    <li>70%
    		natural and rehabilitated (11.2 ha) </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Features of the Site</h3>
<p align="left">There
	are a few other features we need to look for in
	an ideal ecovillage site.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>1.&nbsp; Proximity to civilization.</strong>&nbsp; Not
	everyone wants to live out in the sticks, and indeed,
	the whole point of this business is to bring ecovillages
	to the masses.&nbsp; The site must be a short drive
	to the nearest population centre, and ideally near
	a train station or bus stop.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>2.&nbsp; Partly or wholly cleared.</strong>&nbsp; A
	fully vegetated site won't be ideal, because we
	don't want to have to cut down any trees to make
	room for houses.&nbsp; If we select a site that
	has been partly cleared, then rehabilitation of
	the cleared land becomes part of the project.&nbsp; While
	this is an extra expense, it will increase the
	environmental value of the ecovillage - we will be
	able to promote what a positive effect the ecovillage
	has had on the land.&nbsp; Also, if
	there has been some clearing we have more flexibility
	about how to lay out the site.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3.&nbsp; Fresh water sources.</strong>&nbsp; A
	creek, stream, river, lake or dams will really
	add something to the site, providing water for
	irrigation and for animals.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>4.&nbsp; Good soil quality.</strong>&nbsp; We
	need to be able to successfully grow a wide range
	of food on the land, so soil testing will be essential
	before purchasing a site.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>5.&nbsp; Unencumbered.</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.&nbsp; Correctly zoned and
	in harmony with council regulations.</strong> &nbsp; Although
	these obstacles can sometimes be overcome, things
	will go much easier if the land is in the correct
	zone (i.e. residential or semi-rural) and if the
	project does not conflict with local council.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">A Single Builder</h3>
<p align="left">This is something that we will
	be doing which is a little different.&nbsp; Because
	most ecovillages are put together by a group of
	independent like-minded people, rather than a property
	development company, the houses (if they are built
	from scratch) are often quite different.&nbsp; For
	example, at the Ecovillage at Currumbin, the residents
	can build any kind of house they like as long as
	it is within certain design parameters.</p>
<p align="left">However, there are significant
	benefits to be had from using a single builder:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The whole site can be constructed as a single,
		integrated system, making the ecovillage more
		beautiful and harmonious, and streamlining
		the integration of homes with the site's energy,
		water and information systems.</li>
    <li>Leveraging cost benefits through re-use of
    	design elements, drawings, and engineering
    	requirements.</li>
    <li>Cost benefits from bulk-buying of building
    	materials.</li>
    <li>Huge reduction in overheads that would be incurred
    	if architects had to check every
    	design.</li>
    <li>Only having to educate one builder about the
    	design goals of the ecovillage.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Ideally, the one
	builder will be us: Green Steel Homes.&nbsp; However,
	for this first ecovillage, this may not be practical
	since Green Steel doesn't actually exist yet.&nbsp; It
	all depends what level of investment the business
	receives and when.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">The Design Team and Interest Group </h2>
<p align="left">The next step from here, other than
	finding an investor and starting the company, is
	to establish two groups.</p>
<h3 align="left">The Design Team </h3>
<p align="left">This group will be mainly comprised
	of people who want to live at Silvergreen, and
	contribute to its form.&nbsp; We will meet
	about once per month (with frequently online
	communication) to develop the designs and plans
	for the ecovillage.</p>
<h3 align="left">The Interest Group</h3>
<p align="left">This larger group will also be comprised
	of potential residents, as well as people who are
	generally interested or who may even be thinking
	of starting their own ecovillage.&nbsp; This group
	will mainly be recipients of emailed updates.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like to join either or
	both of these groups then please proceed to the
	<a href="SilvergreenForm.php">Silvergreen sign-up
	page</a>. </p>
