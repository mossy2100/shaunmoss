<h1>About AscensionTek </h1>
<h2>&nbsp; </h2>
<h2>A bit of background </h2>
<p>AscensionTek grew out of my personal passion, which
	is space, and
	in particular the colonisation of space.&nbsp; After
	reading &quot;Red Mars&quot; in 1999, I realised that
	 humans were going to be living on multiple planets
	<em>within my lifetime</em>.&nbsp; I realised that
	this was a pretty big deal, and I decided I wanted
	to be part of it.&nbsp; At first it was just an interest,
	but over the years that followed, I decided to
	make space colonisation the focal point of my life.</p>
<p>Crazy?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But
	time will tell.&nbsp; All of the major space-faring
	nations are planning moonbases within the next
	quarter-century, and the Space Frontier Foundation
	now has annual business plan competitions for people
	wanting to start space businesses.&nbsp; AscensionTek
	is not the first company with its sights set on
	an eventual marsbase.&nbsp; Why
	should the US be the only country to take private
	space development seriously?&nbsp; Australia can and
	will be a leader in space.</p>
<p>My business plan has been evolving for several years
	now, with the main question being this - &quot;if
	I don't yet have the money or technology to initiate
	space development projects, what should I do in
	the meantime?&quot;&nbsp; I
	experimented with several options - designing a
	Mars computer game, postgrad study in information
	systems and robotics, and writing science fiction
	for 2 years.&nbsp; But
	none of these paths seemed to be leading me towards
	my goal.</p>
<p>Eventually it clicked, and in early 2007 I finally
	understood the best way to get this
	company rolling.&nbsp; The
	realisation came as a result of one thing: <strong>climate
	change</strong>.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this
	year, news about climate change seemed to be everywhere.&nbsp; There
	was &quot;The Inconvenient Truth&quot;, Richard Bransons's
	carbon prize, water restrictions and plans for
	recycled water, and dozens of environmentally-themed
	TV shows.</p>
<p>My first reaction was this - if I have all these
	ideas about the future, maybe it's more responsible
	to use my creative power to help the environment?&nbsp; Being
	a spiritual person, I have a strong sense of service,
	so I begrudgingly made the decision to switch focus.
&nbsp;	Then I saw the &quot;Gaia Selene&quot; DVD,
and realised that space development - apart from being
	a major evolutionary stepping stone - can also
provide solutions to our environmental problems on-planet.</p>
<p>The plan for AscensionTek finally began to crystallise
	into something realistic, which will work, and path
	to success has become clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Development of Business Concept </h2>
<p>AscensionTek was first conceived as &quot;Mars Engineering&quot;
	while I was working in Dublin in 2001.&nbsp; At that
	time the business was focused on development
	of an online virtual environment known as Virtual
	Mars, which would allow people to explore Mars
	and marsbases, and interact with each other in
	a simulated Mars environment.&nbsp; This was the first
	idea I had for a company product, and will hopefully
	still be developed.&nbsp; However, I
	did not push to start a company based
	on it.</p>
<p>From approximately 1999 to 2006 I developed my
	education and interest in space partly as a fun
	hobby, but also with the intention of eventually
	obtaining employment in the space industry.&nbsp; However,
	I eventually realised that to successfully implement
	my personal vision I would need a higher degree
	of independence.&nbsp; After attending the NewSpace space
	business conference in Las Vegas in 2006, I realised
	that commercialisation of space had already begun,
	and that I could realistically start my own space
	development company if I wanted to.</p>
<p>From this point I began to assemble plans and ideas
	for how this might be achieved.&nbsp; Having such
	a varied background meant that it was not
	obvious where to begin, and early plans centred
	on multimedia and software development, and robotics.&nbsp; However,
	with the increased media attention and global focus
	on environmental issues in 2007, I realised
	that environmental products and services would
	be simultaneously lucrative, beneficial for the
	world, and good preparation for space
	development.</p>
<p>With several years experience developing
		software for both the steel building and real
	estate industries, and a sound understanding of
	real estate investment principals, I decided that
	environmentally-oriented property development,
	beginning with ecovillages, would be the best place
	to start.&nbsp; Ideally the business would also be
	structured to gain maximum leverage
	from other skills and knowledge (especially computers)
	as much as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ideas for &quot;Phase 1&quot; Business Development
and Products</h2>
<p>With a background in software development and exposure
	to a range of industries, a number of software
	products suggest themselves.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Software for human community management.</strong></p>
<p>In
	an ecovillage, smart housing community, or indeed
	any modern town or city, data on consumption of
	resources such as water and energy is invaluable.&nbsp; An
	ecovillage (for example) could have a &quot;community
	server&quot; located in its community centre that is
	wirelessly linked to computers in each house known
	as &quot;house servers&quot;.&nbsp; The house servers
	collect data on energy production and usage, water
	usage and recycling rates, temperature, rainfall,
	etc., and transfer this information to the community
	server for assembly into reports.&nbsp; The community
	are then aware of energy and water requirements
	as well as environmental parameters, and
	can modify the built environment as required.&nbsp; The
	house servers could provide this data to residents
	for their own information, along with &quot;smart house&quot;
	features such as security system setup and  timers
	for lights and sprinklers.&nbsp; People would also
	be able to submit their food requirements, providing
	data that would assist in design of the village's
	permaculture and aquaculture systems.</p>
<p>The
		community server would also function as a central
		web server, providing an intranet and communication
		hub for the community as well as a public website.</p>
<p>The data from this kind of software package operating
	in a range of communities would be invaluable in
	design of new ecovillages and sustainable communities.&nbsp; As
	an off-the-shelf product available during a long
	housing boom with an environmental emphasis, as
	is expected over the coming 20-100 years, this
	may be a highly successful product.&nbsp; With developments
	in computing technology and AI, software like this
	can lead to houses and villages with their own
	intelligence and decision-making capaibilites,
	providing a range of automated services to the
	community.</p>
<p><strong>Other ideas include: </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li> Software for human community simulation.</li>
	<li>Software for environmental house
				design and estimating.</li>
	<li> Simulation, design and operational
		software for robotics and automated systems.</li>
</ul>
