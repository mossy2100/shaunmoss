<h2>Brief history of the concept</h2>

<p>I first conceived of the game in 1999. I was interested in game
development at this time, and was developing a fantasy RPG concept with
another programmer when I had the idea for a online Mars game.</p>

<p>Most computer games are based around combat, with differing levels of
violence and destruction. I, however, was more interested in creative,
non-violent games. My favourite genre is sci-fi, and thus one of my
all-time favourite games was <i>Outpost</i>, a base-building game which
came out around 1996. I also enjoyed <i>Civilization</i> (although this
had a military component as well). MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online
Role-Playing Games) were just starting off then, but none of these
really appealed to me (most are fantasy-based rather than sci-fi).</p>

<p>So I conceived of a non-violent, constructive MMORPG which involved
exploration, interaction, and base-building on Mars. Initially called
"Mars 2020", it was renamed "Virtual Mars" and for a time I had a
website at virtualmars.net which presented the idea. The core element of
the game was to be an accurate 3D model of Mars, constructed using data
from the MOLA. (Thanks to the MOLA, Mars's topography is better known
than any other planet in the Solar System, including Earth. The best
usage of this data outside of NASA is probably Adrian Lark's <a
	href='http://mars3d.co.uk'>Mars 3D</a> viewer.)</p>

<p>People generally seemed interested in the idea, especially my friends
in the <a href='http://www.marssociety.com.au'>Mars Society</a>, and I
received numerous emails from visitors to the site asking when the game
would begin. However, at that time I did not resources (or perhaps,
faith) to develop the idea. My goal now is to have the game underway
before the end of 2005.</p>

<p>In 2001 I discovered an online role-playing game/community known as
the <i>Republic of Mars</i>. ROM was essentially a collection of
discussion forums, mailing lists, and websites all base around the idea
of role-playing a government and society on Mars. The game time was
assumed to be current real time plus 20 years. There were no maps or
game environment - everything existed in the imagination of the players.
<i>Martians</i> is essentially Virtual Mars combined with ROM.</p>

<p>The game was popular for a while, and at its height had around 200
players. However, as it was operated purely by its players and had no
development strategy that anyone could agree on, certain issues were
debated interminably and eventually people became frustrated and
interest waned. Nonetheless, several worthwhile things were created
during the experiment, such as an excellent Mars calendar/time-keeping
system, and a Martian constitution, both of which later appeared in John
Wayne Smith's book "On The Road To Mars" (J W Smith is the CEO of <a
	href='http://1000planets.com'>1000 Planets</a>, a space advocacy
group).</p>

<p>There were two spin-offs from ROM created by former players, namely <i>Future
Mars</i> and <i>The Mars Game</i>, however these have both, sadly, died
a quiet death. These games, in my opinion, make the same error as ROM by
not providing a game environment or any rules. <i>Martians</i>, on the
other hand, will be much more fun, enjoyable and interesting with this
important feature.</p>
