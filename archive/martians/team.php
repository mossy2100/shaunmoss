<h2>Development Team</h2>

<p>If I had the cash to develop this game, I would immediately recruit these people.

<p><i>Adrian Lark</i>, a programmer from England who wrote the Mars 3D viewer (www.mars3d.co.uk).  Adrian probably knows more than anyone, outside of NASA, about using MOLA data to create 3D models and visualizations of Mars.

<p><i>Scott Davis</i>, a programmer from Wisconsin, whom I know through the Mars Society.  Scott is the programmer of Mars Sim, a simulation of a future Mars colony.  The user specifies parameters such as number of colonists and bases so on, and the program is left to run.  The result is like watching an ant colony - the colonists drive around Mars, doing their work and developing Mars.  Every colonist has their own personality, functions and tasks, which affects what they do.  Rovers have their own algorithms as well.  Not only is Scott an expert Java programmer, he has put considerable thought into the details of Mars colonies.

<p><i>Steve Heaton</i>, a skilled programmer and astronomer from New South Wales.  Steve has written software which simulates Mars's weather, day-night cycle, and positions in the sky of Mars's moons.  Using Steve's algorithms will provide a whole new layer of realism to the game.
