<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>Certain technological advancements are assumed to have been made over the next 50 years, which affect the colonists.

<h5>Nuclear Fusion</h5>

<p>This form of energy production is reliable, safe, and non-polluting.  Most big cities now have their own reactor, and power plants using fossil fules or nuclear fission are being replaced worldwide.  Most fusion reactors use Helium-3 mined from the Moon.


<h5>Genetic Engineering</h5>

<p>This field of science has advanced far enough that plants are being engineered that will grow in a mixture of Martian and Earth dirt.  Research is being done to develop micro-organisms, worms, and fish that can live unprotected on Mars.


<h5>Communications and Information</h5>

<p>As on Earth, satellites have been positioned in Martian orbits to provide global communications.  Anyone can access an ultra-high-speed internet connection almost anytime, including via a wristpad, marssuit or vehicle.  This provides instant access to information, and communication with anyone else on the planet.



<h5>Robotics</h5>

<p>Artificial intelligence and robotics have come a long way.  Robots are used extensively in exploration, farming and mining, key activities on Mars.  The main advancement in robotics is in problem-solving and algorithm design, which means that most robots only need to be given targets and do not need to be told exactly how to reach those targets - they can determine how to do it themselves.
